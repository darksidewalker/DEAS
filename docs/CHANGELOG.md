# Changelog

## Unreleased — 0.1.64

- Windows: **Update** no longer fails with "self-update is unsupported" when only ComfyUI or DaSiWa-nodes are behind. The application step reads the latest release first and, when this build is current, lets the backend upgrade run; a newer DEAS release still stops it with a manual-download message naming the version. Missing or invalid release versions fail closed rather than being treated as current.

- Windows: the Rust library suite passes on Windows. Five tests assumed Linux: `python3` (a Microsoft Store placeholder on Windows), uncanonicalized 8.3 temp paths (projects, extra model roots), a `jpg`/`JPG` name collision on a case-insensitive filesystem (starred media), and a log byte-cap test that overflowed the shared log and evicted entries other parallel tests were reading (both jobs log tests). Test-only, except that the log store's push/trim moved onto `Store` so the cap test can use a private store.

- Windows: the expected "spellchecking configuration unsupported" state is logged as a warning instead of an error on every launch; missing dictionaries and invalid languages stay errors.

- Setup recovery after a failed or cancelled install: Setup plans again instead of retrying the consumed plan ("Unknown or already consumed plan ID"), keeping the failed run's logs visible. A folder left by an interrupted install (`deas-plan.json` without `deas-install.json`) now says so for new installs, reopening and takeover, instead of pointing at a reopen that cannot work. The uv download fails only after 60 s without data (15-minute ceiling) with a "uv download stalled" message, instead of a fixed 180 s total surfacing as "error decoding response body".

- Add optional learned H3 and LTX latent upscale under Generate → Post-Processing, using family-specific safetensors in `latent_upscale_models`. Missing-model activation offers the existing Library flow in a popup; downloads remain explicitly authorized. The final generation latent is upscaled before decoding, without a lossy video round trip; existing LTX multipass controls stay separate. Paired Original/Processed video outputs retain their roles. H3 segment-capture pairing now compiles with exactly one Segment Decode: the Processed video comes from the upscaled decode, and the Original baseline is assembled on core nodes (core VAE decode of the prepared window plus an `ImageFromBatch` crop mirroring the nodepack's continuation timing, with audio reused from the Segment Decode), with the pinned checkpoint clip's frame count resolved from the session list at prepare time; first takes, imported-video pins and clip lists stay fail closed. Strict baseline-first failure preservation remains unverified.

## Unreleased — 0.1.63

- Add right-aligned Studio prompt character counts, shared inline/enlarged spelling aids with an independent remembered system-default language, and default-off autocomplete using Prompt Forge’s local tag search. Backend language settings and Quick Settings control both aids without changing generation settings or submitting prompts.

## Unreleased

- Chat prompt writing now routes by requested model: refer to its Prompt Forge mode first, otherwise use a compatible registered simple writer, otherwise refuse. Remove the four-image-model replacement choice; guides remain available for explanations and never imply writer support.

- Keep known models in the wrong loader folder visible but disabled in Studio, with localized folder guidance. Native preparation distinguishes a model found only in the other loader list from an absent model. No automatic moves, loader fallback or unknown-checkpoint filtering.

## Unreleased — 0.1.62

- H3 References now shows compact selected-media thumbnails with current stream/trim summaries. The Edit button carries a copper glow so the opened media editor is easy to spot. Each Edit button opens a separate modal for that reference’s existing playback, crop, Forge labels/details and people controls. Closing it retains changes, stops its player and returns to the selected card; Escape does not close the underlying References overlay. Native video thumbnails use a cached frame at the selected crop start without a WebKit video decoder. Originals and execution settings remain unchanged.

- The preview **More** menu now closes on its second click and on any click outside it. **Use these settings** moved from the metadata dock into the More menu, joined by **Reuse prompt**, which fills prompt, negative prompt, seed, steps, CFG, sampler, scheduler and size from the selected file's embedded generation metadata. The metadata dock stays display-only.

- Correct the shared Linux video-player seek and volume tracks: theme-colored fill ends at the playhead, the full 0–100% range is usable without input-field padding, and current/total time plus volume percentage stay visible. Replace platform-dependent play/mute glyphs with themed SVG controls; preserve native playback and forced mute.

## Unreleased — 0.1.60

- Media dock: on Text → Image / Image → Image with a model that supports image prompting, right-click an image → **Use as prompt reference** (the same reference as dropping the tile on the prompt; disabled with the 4-reference count when full, badged in the dock, and the entry becomes **Remove reference** on referenced tiles).

## Unreleased — 0.1.59

- Preserve current reference additions and crop edits during native file drops; ignore drops belonging to a different modal/background browser and discard file descriptions that finish after the picker closes.

- Move Multi-reference management into a Continuity-style modal with its own shared media picker, reference lanes and inline image/video/audio previews. Preserve labels, people, Forge details, RefMods, packs and non-destructive selection.
- Add source-duration-aware numeric/range crop controls, playhead-to-start/end, reset and Play crop for video/audio. Audition video-only muted, audio-only without a picture, or synchronized picture and sound; send the same selected stream and crop to H3. Linux video reuses the native libmpv path. Known crop lengths, per-stream 15-second totals and the Director’s both-stream reference count are validated before submission.

## Unreleased — 0.1.58

- Enable the existing H3 Continuity planner for Video → Video and Multi-reference → Video, matching the Director’s REF2VA mode. Keep checkpoint/imported-video sources, serial Run next/all, overlap and full/segment outputs. An optional, default-off current-reference switch drives both generation and Next action Forge; tail-only continuation skips unused media uploads and RefMods. Native REF2VA continuation validation and exact requested-duration forwarding are included; ordinary runs and older intents retain their existing contracts. LTX/Wan continuity is not added.

## Unreleased — 0.1.57

- Media dock: Image → Video now offers **Use as input** on an image’s right-click menu, alongside the existing Video → Video **Use as source video** action. Both select the clicked source directly; preview buttons and preview-only browsing are unchanged.

- Preview toolbar: the **More** button shows a dropdown caret and opens Refine/Upscale as an overlay menu stacked top-down (the open menu no longer pushes the controls and caption below). The separate **Full view** button is gone — clicking the media in the view already opens it. Browsed and noneditable source-media controls share the top strip with **Metadata** on desktop; editor/result controls keep their own rows, and narrow previews reserve space for wrapped controls and warnings. **More** labels remain on one line inside a bounded, scrollable menu; bottom-row menus open upward. Original-image mouse and keyboard actions retain the selected job’s source/Star identity, independently of the current edit draft.

## Unreleased — 0.1.56

- One build everywhere: `video-upscale` is now a default Cargo feature, so every Linux and Windows DEAS binary includes the native TVE spatial engine (ONNX Runtime loaded dynamically at runtime, nothing bundled or auto-downloaded, no GPU/runtime initialization at startup). The separate `deas-linux-amd64-video-upscale` variant is retired — engine use stays an explicit runtime opt-in (settings + trusted runtime/model binding).

## Unreleased — 0.1.55

- Prompt Forge, the hammer and Chat no longer say a server is needed when one is already connected: the "local GGUF runner does not support tool calls" warning now appears only when local GGUFs are the only models found. Beside a usable server, local GGUFs stay listed and greyed out.
- Fix video source inspection failing intermittently on Windows with VIDEO_PROBE_FAILED for valid files (about two in three attempts): Windows sets ffprobe's exit code before the process is fully finished, and the cleanup job kill in that window overwrote the code with 1. The probe's exit status is now read after the process has finished and before the cleanup kill.
- Studio preview: the Post-process button is now a **More** dropdown under *Use as input*, offering **Refine** (the refine+upscale pass alone, with the hint) and **Upscale** (the upscale pass alone, no diffusion, no sigmas) — both run immediately with the Post-Processing settings on the shown image.
- Studio preview controls unified: the control row (Use as input, edit modes, inpaint, last frame, star, More, …) rides the stage header row right-aligned, ending before the Metadata pill on the same line, and every control — buttons, the More summary, the stars — shares the Metadata pill's round-pill shape, height and font.
- More (Refine/Upscale) now appears on every image preview, including dock-browsed files: the file is uploaded and the Post-Processing settings run directly on it (target = current canvas size × upscale factor).
- Fix video source inspection rejecting every file chosen through a symlinked directory (bookmarks like ~/Downloads): parent-directory links are ordinary navigation and only the selected file itself must not be a link. Admission failures now name the reason (VIDEO_SYMLINK / VIDEO_SIZE / VIDEO_TYPE) instead of one generic VIDEO_SOURCE message.

- Fix the recurring footer-only empty band at the shared viewport boundary, not per tab. All active panes inherit the shell height; hidden retained panes stay out of layout. Remove competing Workbench/Forge/Chat height formulas and Logs/Comfy wrapper exceptions. Long/narrow content scrolls internally, and wrapped narrow preview tools no longer cover output-role controls. Add a dynamic all-tab browser regression gate to frontend CI, with future-pane and deliberate broken-layout controls.

- Add the explicitly enabled Linux TVE native engine: trusted runtime/model/optional-cuDNN binding, Validate & render, serialized job status and explicit Stop. Rust runs the current executable as a private worker before GTK startup, with bounded versioned IPC, immutable native authorities, parent-owned cleanup and final no-clobber publication. One process-scoped dependency is loaded only when selected; foreign services/models are untouched.
- Interlock DEAS-managed Comfy submissions and TVE renders without claiming global GPU arbitration. Separate render/code-execution permission from read-only inspection. Protect streaming codecs and the initial inspector against forced worker death; reject glibc loader tokens at the common native runtime boundary, with focused red/green regressions.
- Keep the ordinary build inference-off and stage a distinct AI-enabled binary. Real CUDA app-worker and managed-parent video tests preserve source bytes, four-frame timing and AAC metadata; normal-build worker mode exits unsupported before GTK. Playback/comparison, long/full-resolution video, additional model stages and Windows rendering remain outside this bounded path.

- Bind explicit native video inspections to a single retained session source ID, without granting authority to the standalone CLI inspection helper. Add native chooser-only new-MP4 output preparation and explicit source/directory/destination recheck; browser requests carry IDs/settings/title rather than file paths. Failed/cancelled selection preserves prior usable state; changed sources, directory replacements and occupied targets invalidate preparation. No file is created and all model/timing/encoder/processing readiness flags remain false.
- Add six-language TVE preparation cards/actions with duplicate-request guards and stale-result fencing. Legacy inspections without source IDs remain usable for metadata drafts; no model selector, GPU job or Render action is enabled.

## Unreleased — 0.1.53

- Add a dedicated TVE main tab for standalone video post-processing authoring, separate from Generate's image Post-Processing dock. Lazy mounting retains source inspection/output choices/checked drafts across app navigation; opening or restoring the tab does not probe, load models or submit work. Keep the Generate workbench and existing image actions mounted and unchanged.
- Add an optional Linux-only Rust short-clip streaming core and actual-session `upscale_video` developer example: bounded raw RGB pipes, complete rational frame timing checks, AAC audio mapping, cooperative cancellation/owned-child cleanup, completed-file verification and no-clobber MP4 publication. Source/output limits and unsupported platforms fail explicitly; real-codec CPU tests are not AI-video acceptance. No TVE Render action is enabled.
- Add explicit Rust metadata output-draft validation for 1×/2×/4× and MP4/H.264, MKV/H.264 or WebM/VP9 profiles, with exact rational cadence, audio omission/mapping, source warnings, target-size limits and explicit subtitle blockers. Edits invalidate obsolete drafts; all readiness flags remain false. No executable video plan, encoder discovery, model selection, preview, Run/queue, JSON import/export or video output is advertised.

## Unreleased — 0.1.52

- Add explicit local video source inspection to Post-Processing: a Rust-owned, bounded native FFprobe process reports dimensions, exact rational cadence, stream metadata and conservative timing/color/interlace/rotation/alpha/pixel-aspect blockers. Preserve the previous result on chooser cancellation, prevent duplicate inspection and route sanitized operation diagnostics to central Logs. No file upload, model/GPU initialization, output write or video Run action.
- Record the owner’s complete-Rust requirement for the standalone video enhancement/inference pipeline; no Go server or Python worker. Source inspection does not establish full CFR verification, inference compatibility or executable enhancement. Existing ComfyUI image behavior remains separate.

## Unreleased — 0.1.51

- Save separate Original and Processed image products for the existing optional refine/upscale chain, with a composed pre-refine baseline, native/TypeScript compiler parity and graph-derived roles. Keep final filenames and no-refine graphs unchanged; selected saver format/compression applies to both products.
- Select paired outputs individually, compare the actual baseline/result, and retain reported completed products on failed/cancelled jobs with indexed PNG preview/export. A backend success missing either paired product is not reported as complete. Baseline saving is still an independent ComfyUI branch: failures before it executes can leave no baseline; strict pre-refinement publication and the streamed video worker remain planned.

## Unreleased — 0.1.50

- Match prerequisite model names with separator-insensitive comparison so Windows subfolder paths (`Anima\model+Int8.safetensors`) validate against the backend's slash-separated combos; `+` in names was already allowed.

## 0.1.49

- Add every fixed main-Settings aspect preset to ordinary native Prompt Forge modes. Preserve no-hint behavior, per-target saved choices and legacy labels; MOSS Layout JSON retains its existing pack canvases. Auto/custom and full layout/Generate geometry remain deferred.

- Share the native image-reference encoder mapping between the recipe compiler and Studio readiness checks. MOSS reference recipes no longer require the unused `CLIPTextEncode` node; plain generation still does, and missing active encoders continue to block Run. Existing graph identities, family constraints and upload snapshots are unchanged.

- Fix Windows/Linux path compatibility across exact ComfyUI model identifiers, media references, output subfolders/Starred moves, model-tree display, Git discovery and Explorer paths. Remove developer-specific graph-validation paths, use UTF-8 tool I/O and close SQLite handles before replacement; align build staging with `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` and preserve Windows UNC/caller directories. Keep protocol traversal/no-clobber guards and external ComfyUI files unchanged. See [path contracts and limits](PATH-COMPATIBILITY.md).

- Tie optional native preview observers to job ownership, terminal commits and confirmed Workbench Stop, with wakeable cancellation and bounded graceful socket cleanup. Submission, unknown-state reconciliation, history and outputs retain their existing contracts; native acceptance is pending.
- Add shared Settings ratios to native image Prompt Forge and standalone H3, explicit N/A/Auto/Custom dimensions, request-bound MOSS layouts and guarded Send-to-Generate canvas transfer. Native geometry is checked before inference; legacy LTX/Wan remain explicitly prompt-only. Native/platform acceptance is pending.
- Keep applicable Studio media actions in a contained, wrapping bottom row across browsed previews, adopted editors and selected results, preserving media eligibility, retained drafts and per-output Star/Unstar actions.
- Add optional global recent-generation metadata for ten native attempts and a Studio history view with explicit compatible-settings restore, unresolved dependency gates and output-location repair after Star/Unstar. Media and the separate live queue are preserved. Source candidate; [batch verification and native acceptance limits](VERIFICATION.md#batch-b-recent-generation-history-unreleased) apply. No version bump or release.
- Keep historical inputs unresolved until explicit Media reselection and invalidate output-availability labels on selected-context changes, record updates and close. Preserve reference order/strengths and ignore obsolete availability replies.

## 0.1.48

Includes the model-aware reference wiring developed under 0.1.47 below, plus compact drag-only reference thumbnails. Local unsigned release; platform/model acceptance limits are recorded in [verification](VERIFICATION.md).

- Replace full-width prompt-reference filename rows with compact numbered thumbnails, red overlay removal controls, and drag-only reordering. Keep filenames available as accessible image descriptions/tooltips, preserve each picture's ReVision strength, and submit the displayed reference order without changing already captured jobs.

## Unreleased — 0.1.47

- Keep Krea/MOSS numbered reference placeholders bound to the intended images on both prompt branches, including out-of-order markers. Carry image eligibility in the internal drag MIME types so protected drag payloads do not advertise video/audio as attachable pictures. Add real-core tokenizer and protected-drag regressions; verify GPU reference effects for Qwen Turbo, MOSS and Krea at fixed prompt/seed.

- Wire one prompt-picture draft through model-specific image execution: retain SDXL ReVision, add Qwen Image 2.1/Turbo core text/vision plus ordered reference latents, and Krea 2/MOSS text/vision conditioning through the bundled `DEAS_ImagePromptEncode` adapter. Route both conditioning branches where required, preserve sampler/custom-sigma/refine consumers and upload references outside configured media roots. Native picture paths do not expose ineffective ReVision strengths/vision pickers. Missing capabilities block Run; no automatic backend restart, external node installation or model download. Run Plan shows attached pictures. Experimental edit-LoRA/reference-latent modes and generic Anima references are not added.

## Unreleased — 0.1.46

- Remove the unsupported-reference paragraph below the prompt and refuse unsupported model-family drops with `dropEffect:none` instead of a misleading green copy/plus cursor. Existing ReVision compatibility and model-native input paths are unchanged.

- Fix internal media-image drags losing their prompt-field drop to Linux native file handling: replace default image URI/HTML drag data with the existing DEAS media payload and copy semantics in the shared helper (Media dock, preview and queue). Keep native OS-drop handling enabled. Hide and restore the Linux native-video overlay during internal drags: its full-window GTK surface blocked drop destinations even with no video open.

- Add Studio image-reference prompting (ReVision) for SDXL checkpoint image recipes: drop up to 4 images on the prompt field with per-reference strength, a shared CLIP-vision model picker and a visible "count of 4" indicator. Compile the core unCLIP conditioning chain (shared vision loader, per-image encode, chained conditioning) in the shared TS and native Rust paths with prerequisites and six-language controls; uploaded references stay immutable per Run press. Families with native image paths (image-to-image input slot, video References tab) keep their own paths and show a localized explanation instead of references. When no CLIP-vision model is installed, the Workbench asks at drop time whether to download clip_vision_g (CLIP-ViT-bigG fp16, 3.7 GB) from Hugging Face into models/clip_vision; the download catalog ships a matching HF entry.
- Allow repeated Studio Run presses during queued/running work, with immutable per-press intents and captured random/fixed seeds. Add adjacent six-language Run/Stop controls, discard unsent preparations on Stop and preserve real partial/unknown results. A native admission-generation fence rejects delayed pre-Stop Run requests even after Stop completes; no global interrupt, queue clear or service stop.
- Connect Studio image/video/Post-process and Continuity runs to the native Workbench collection, restore held session jobs without resubmission and observe all held jobs with collection polling. Keep submitted settings immutable through uploads, preserve original job/output identity and match Continuity results by job ID. Diagnostic controls remain separate.
- Add confirmed native-only whole-Workbench Stop coordination: block new admissions during Stop, discard unsent preparations, settle submissions exactly once and reuse targeted pending deletion/scoped running interruption only for native-held jobs. Preserve unknown outcomes and completed products; return explicit empty/settled/partial results, and finish after IPC waiter loss. No global queue clear or service stop; Studio now calls this coordinator through the split Run/Stop control. `stopAvailable:true` advertises coordinator support, not universal per-job cancellation.
- Add confirmed native-only interruption of one correlated running Workbench prompt through an owned, per-launch-authenticated route that holds the queue mutex across target validation and flag setting. Never call core's racy/global `/interrupt`; require launch-captured inspected sources, retain uncertain outcomes and prevent repeat mutations. Fix standalone status-waiter abortion leaving polling permanently busy. Combined Studio Stop reuses this scoped operation.
- Add explicit native-only cancellation of one correlated pending Workbench prompt on the currently owned running backend. Verify queue/history after the targeted delete, retain uncertain outcomes and prevent repeat delete attempts. Add the terminal Cancelled state and six-language presentation; combined Studio Stop reuses this targeted operation.
- Add the native-only Workbench all-job polling foundation for the existing bounded session collection. Refresh correlated submitted jobs without resubmitting, preserve unknown outcomes and keep no-network session snapshots separate. Studio now reuses this same collection and keeps diagnostic execution separate.
- Block image Run before preparation when Wildcards is enabled but its node is missing, including MOSS. Keep the user's wildcard choices until they explicitly disable the feature; available plugins retain the existing intent.

## Unreleased — 0.1.45

- Add a bounded MOSS-Image family adapter for Text → Image and ordinary denoise-based Image → Image, using the dedicated MOSS text encoder, Flux2 VAE/empty latent and model-aligned dimensions. Validate the nodes actually emitted by the selected image graph instead of unused baseline nodes. Model loading, packed encoder support and generation quality remain unverified; unsupported MOSS combinations fail closed.
- Queue outputs have individually associated corner star overlays and localized measured generation time in succeeded rows/details. Image and video metadata share timing formatting; unknown/failed durations are omitted. Repeated Run, split Stop and client elapsed timers remain planned.

## Unreleased — 0.1.44

- Centralize dropdown styling across all tabs using the compact Settings appearance. New native select fields inherit it automatically; theme-aware arrows, option colours, focus and disabled states replace per-feature styling. Keep native keyboard interaction and high-contrast fallback.

- Bundle pinned PromptForge prompts, Randomizer, tag and character data in the portable executable, with local read-only overrides and no first-use download. Adopt GPL-3.0-or-later with upstream notices.
- Bound streamed tool-call indices, make Chat requests cancellable, and retain current project/chat/reference state when asynchronous results arrive. Native model discovery no longer requires a running ComfyUI backend.

- **Prompt Forge for Illustrious, Anima, Krea2 and MOSS runs natively.** It replaces the node pack's Prompt Writer for these image models with PromptForge's pipeline in DEAS: character canon from local tables, the `search_tags` and `read_guidance` tools inside the writing loop, the `===SEGMENT:` contract and PromptForge's mechanical clean-up. Requests go straight to the LLM server under **Backend → LLM backend** (Ollama or OpenAI-compatible); the local GGUF runner cannot call tools yet and says so. Data is bundled; `<environment>/forge-data` can override individual files. MiniMax H3, Wan and LTX stay on the node pack. See [Prompting](PROMPTING.md#prompt-forge).
- The Generate hammer rewrites image prompts with the native writer (a source picture still goes to the node writer). The Prompt Forge tab gains a native editor with mode, detail, creativity, quality preset, style, aspect, optional negative/notes segments, kept-verbatim fields and **Send prompt** / **Send prompt + negative**. MOSS joins **Write for**.
- The Prompt Forge tab for image models becomes PromptForge's builder: named-notch Detail/Creativity sliders, folding sections with summaries (Setting presets, Output, Kept as written, Camera, Lighting, Tags), chips for quality and style, icon tiles for aspect, camera angle, distance and light direction, a Lighting slider (now sent to the model), Length (words or a token cap), a tag search with weighted pills and character traits from the local tables, the Randomizer, and a result panel with an empty state, Refine, Second pass, Undo, Copy all and Clear. MOSS offers Natural language and Layout JSON (Hybrid held back). The data pack now carries PromptForge's second-pass instruction (`tools/export-forge-pack.mjs`), and `forge-data/randomizer.json` holds the Randomizer's vocabulary.
- **Studio → Chat**, PromptForge's chat run natively: streamed answers, saved conversations per environment, pictures (never saved), "include what I'm working on", and tools for writing image prompts with the real prompt writers (shown as cards with **Send to Generate**), reading model and DEAS guides (H3/Wan/LTX included) and looking tags up. Optional web search (off by default; DuckDuckGo or your own SearXNG) with cited results. See [Chat](CHAT.md).
- Colour schemes under **Quick Settings → Colour scheme**, based on Darksidewalker's OCs: Default, Liiti Pink, VOID (renamed from Voud without resetting saved choices), Alluring Abyss (dark red), Slimy Teal, Clawy Grey, Android White (light) and Dragon's Hoard. Every stylesheet colour is now a token in `src/styles.css`; Default keeps the existing look. See [Studio](STUDIO.md#colour-schemes).
- The MOSS Layout Studio in the Prompt Forge tab (MOSS → Layout JSON): boxes on a canvas sized by the aspect, a Global prompt and medium, Rewrite for the scene or one box, live MOSS Layout JSON, undo/redo, and PromptForge's two steps (Generate prompt, Generate JSON). Drawn boxes are kept exactly; the model writes only their captions. The pack carries the studio's Rewrite instruction.
- Reference images in the Prompt Forge tab: pictures with a role, a fidelity and a note; **Analyze** reads one back; a write reads them first under their roles and writes from that reading (PromptForge's reference blueprint), with the reading shown under the result and kept for Refine and Second pass. The pack now carries PromptForge's reference roles, fidelities and reading instructions.
- The Generate hammer for image models is a quick text rewrite with PromptForge's defaults: the popup shows the current and the new prompt side by side (**Use new prompt** / **Keep current**), and an Image to Image source picture is no longer sent.
- Native model listing runs the local folder scan and the remote endpoint listing concurrently (local models stay first in the list, warnings unchanged), and the node-pack model listing runs alongside the readiness check instead of after it. Prompt Forge, Chat, the Generate hammer and the people helper all share that path.

- Fix Windows owned-backend start failing with "Startup collision: foreign listener owns the chosen port": the venv `python.exe` is a launcher whose child owns the socket, so a live member of the backend's Job Object is now accepted as the owner.

- The embedded PromptForge data is zstd-compressed (fixed level, deterministic) and decoded before use; manifest digests pin the compressed payload and a raw override file still reads as-is. The release profile also uses LTO with one codegen unit. The Linux executable drops from 74.5 MiB to 29.1 MiB.

- **Bundled PromptForge data has a reviewed update path**: `tools/update-forge-data.py` (`--check`, `--update`, `--verify`) selects a pinned upstream revision, exports the pack inside a read-only Bubblewrap sandbox, validates digests, SQLite integrity/schema and row counts, writes only substantive changes with a rollback-safe swap, and stops with `review-required` on license/notice changes. A weekly review PR workflow runs the same import; no runtime updater and no automatic merge. See [Bundled PromptForge data updates](FORGE-DATA-UPDATES.md).

## Unreleased — 0.1.42

- Every red banner and alert message (studio, setup, jobs, logs) gets a Dismiss × button so users can close error banners without the underlying state changing.

- Show localized, actionable backend discovery messages for unavailable connections, timeouts/interrupted requests and HTTP failures instead of raw `object_info` transport URLs. Keep validation and uncertain execution failures distinct. Respect explicit log severity so ComfyUI's `[WARNING] send error` stays a warning rather than becoming an error. Close job-preview WebSockets with a bounded handshake and correlate completion events to their own prompt instead of dropping the transport on any completion event.

- Share the complete Media panel and toolbar between Studio and Prompt Forge. Forge gains the same search, sorting, media-type/view controls and Output/Starred/Input browsing without duplicating browser code; preserve separate host preferences and explicit prompt/reference execution.

- Restore the clickable footer version as a tiny transparent overlay: explicitly remove native button appearance, borders, shadows and minimum sizing without changing update confirmation or workspace layout.

- Owned-backend controls are now uniform short actions — Start, Test, Stop, Restart, Inspect. **Test** runs a quick read-only dependency check and lists each item with a green ✓ or red ✗: installed environment, Python venv, ComfyUI, DaSiWa nodes, backend API (new `native_backend_test` command, six locales, mock-IPC tests).

- Keep Library metadata scans running as native background work across tab changes, with file/count progress in CLI and shared Logs. After a verified binary update, DEAS automatically closes and reopens once backend updates and pending work/project saves complete. Footer version and Upgrade both ask for confirmation before application/backend updates; the application updater checks the latest release and safely replaces a supported binary only when a verified newer asset is available.

- Split Generate’s Wildcards and Presets tabs. Wildcards retains its existing library controls; Presets saves named live Studio settings, loads without execution and updates explicitly with overwrite confirmation. Native bounded/atomic storage, six locales and regression tests accompany the feature.
- Release builds strip binary symbols (`strip = true`), shrinking the Linux release binary.

All notable changes to DEAS — Dark Engine AI Studio. Versions match `package.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` and `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`. Verification evidence lives in [docs/VERIFICATION.md](VERIFICATION.md); the roadmap in [docs/PLAN.md](PLAN.md).

## Unreleased — 0.1.41

- **FFmpeg (opt-in) is now installable**: checking it no longer blocks the plan with "Unsupported options". The installer adds an `ffmpeg` step — `uv pip install imageio-ffmpeg` into the managed venv and copies the static FFmpeg binary to `venv/bin/ffmpeg` (`venv/Scripts/ffmpeg.exe` on Windows) — and the launched ComfyUI process gets the venv bin on its PATH. Reopen accepts environments installed with the option. (Previously ffmpeg, sage, radial and flash opt-ins were all stubs marked unsupported; sage/radial/flash remain unsupported.)

- **Foreign installation takeover**: a toggle button beside "Choose parent folder" adopts a local folder containing `ComfyUI/main.py` that DEAS does not manage. DEAS shows an explicit warning, requires a confirm dialog, deletes and rebuilds only the folder's venv/runtime, resets the chosen ComfyUI ref, writes the DEAS manifests and never touches models, inputs, outputs or untracked files. Managed folders reopen normally; running servers stay on the existing backend-address connect path. Legacy install manifests (written before takeover existed) reopen without "plan manifest does not match" errors — plain plans serialize without the takeover field.
- **Additional model roots**: Settings and the setup draft accept an optional list of extra model folders (e.g. a second drive). ComfyUI receives one `extra_model_paths` YAML block per root, the model library scans all roots, and the folder mover never moves external roots. Empty lists save byte-identical to the old payload.
- **Scan Files** in Library → Installed: batch CivitAI lookup with an All / Models / LoRAs scope select, reusing the per-file scan (hash cached, sequential requests) for names, trigger words, optimal settings and previews, with an explicit hint that this takes a long time.
- Quick Settings gear button renders as a labeled button matching its header siblings.
- Place text encoders, image/video/audio VAEs and text projections in one initially collapsed **Model files** menu below the other Studio settings. Keep selected files and independent All files switches intact.
- Share the compact Media selector skin with all Studio Settings dropdowns, including Pipeline, aspect/resolution, sampler/scheduler and scaling. Replace the static checkpoint readout with a scanned-model dropdown synchronized bidirectionally with the Models dock through its existing selection/defaults handler; preserve pipeline gates, missing selections and explicit Run authorization.

## Unreleased — 0.1.40

- Detect supported text-encoder/VAE companion architectures from safetensors tensor names and shapes, keeping real filenames independent of provider renaming. Header identities take precedence over filename hints.
- Rework companion dropdowns as full-width compact selectors with explicit automatic recommendations and independent, default-off **All files** switches for text encoders, VAEs, audio VAEs and text projections. Keep models selectable while companions are missing, but block Run until requirements are explicitly satisfied. Preserve manual choices, category/backend/path safeguards and immutable submitted jobs.

## Unreleased — 0.1.39

- Show hover hints where buttons are not self-explanatory: the disabled Run button names its blocking reason (backend, size, missing mask, no checkpoint, unavailable selections), icon-only seed ±/history, last-frame remove and the pane/dock resize handles get native tooltips from their existing labels.

- Fix Studio skipping a changed model folder while an earlier scan is pending. Scan the new root immediately and ignore obsolete results/errors; preserve the installer-to-Studio folder handoff without requiring a second selection in Settings.

- Run every managed Python child (backend, install steps, LLM worker) with `PYTHONUTF8=1` so stdout/stderr are UTF-8 on Windows consoles (cp1252). Fixes the DaSiWa startup emoji raising UnicodeEncodeError during ComfyUI import, which failed node loading and installation validation ("Owned path missing").

- Fix the first-open missing-directory error: initialize missing `raw/` or `starred/` only beneath the native-approved Output root, using anchored no-follow creation. Preserve arbitrary browse errors and existing files; report initialization failures in shared Logs.

- Add Unstar to the existing per-media star control. Use the fixed `Output/raw/<Output naming>` ↔ `Output/starred/<Output naming>` layout, preserving full named paths. Existing stars work without receipts; no-clobber, native idle checks, reference repair and shared Logs remain. Do not draw stars on Input tiles. Use Output/Starred/Input buttons (raw/starred/input) instead of the superseded light switch, with a relative folder tree anchored at the Output folder as root. No media migration, overwrites or deletion; project-linked/sidecar-associated moves remain unavailable.

## Unreleased — 0.1.38 follow-up

- Share the compact Media dropdown skin with Backend settings, including language, Startup, LLM and installation-review backend selection. Move the vertical Backend menu above the pane at widths up to 480px so selected built-in labels fit; preserve all configuration/execution behavior.

- Patch the bundled Linux Matroska cluster scanner to rescan inconsistent candidates instead of aborting WebKit; retain the original Ubuntu security patches and host-plugin preference without bundling a core/runtime dependency closure. Add a reproducible plugin rebuild and native WebKitGTK playback probe. Default NVIDIA's video DMA-BUF sink workaround only when unset, and route plugin-cache failures to shared Logs. Full owner-clip/audio/normal-driver/Windows playback acceptance remains open.

- Clear corrected dependency warnings after a blocked Post-process action instead of retaining an old translated warning as an operation error. Keep current incompatibilities blocking Run and preserve unrelated preparation/job errors.

- Replace WebKit video decoding with an embedded libmpv player for Linux Studio previews: native GL rendering on the main window, bounded open/seek/pause/mute/volume IPC with path/backend-output validation, shared-Logs diagnostics and a dev-server native probe. Both owner clips passed embedded playback, seek and end-of-file checks; Windows stays on the supported web path, and audible A/V sync, normal-driver performance and Windows runtime acceptance remain open.

## 0.1.38 — 2026-10-21

- Restore the full-size Run button with its small adjoining project dropdown on the right; put project status below instead of consuming Run width. Restrict click-to-enlarge to the actual contained image, not letterbox margins. Keep normal-size compact selector text readable in GTK/WebKit. Render missing/incompatible dependencies and job errors as reddish overlays inside View, and decode backend exception text without JSON-escaped newline suffixes.
- Guard header resets before Studio exists, inactive Forge readiness redirects, adopted-editor visibility after starring and stale star-action completions on a changed file.
- Move drag/drop guidance inline immediately after Media Depth without a separate background or file-view overlay. Compact Depth and align sorting/filter/view selector heights with the search field.
- Compact project actions beside Run, with revision-checked native draft ZIP export/import and bounded no-clobber archive validation. Packages contain the baseline image draft and its managed PNG only; full Studio-state, generated-result/job and revision persistence remain unfinished.
- Add independently resizable Settings/View/Queue columns, remembered pane sizes and Quick Settings beside GitHub. Separate layout reset from confirmed authoring-default reset, including Options, LoRAs, presets/wildcards and post-processing; preserve global/project isolation and submitted jobs.
- Route unconfigured LLM entry points to Backend's LLM pane without generation or transfer. Preserve drafts and distinguish missing setup from a configured backend's failure.
- Add per-media stars with native collision-safe physical moves to the owned Output/starred folder and in-session output/preview reference repair. Unsafe/external, project-managed and detected sidecar-associated files remain explicitly unavailable; no unstar policy is invented.

## Unreleased — 0.1.37

- Replace the stacked Startup optimizations, LLM backend and Provider authorization cards with a left selection menu and one consistently styled right-hand pane. Keep visited drafts mounted across panel/main-tab navigation, reset runtime state by environment, retain global authorization drafts, and propagate credential revisions to Library. Add vertical keyboard navigation and disable runtime choices until an installed root is available; selection itself never saves, restarts or executes.

## Unreleased — 0.1.36

- Default image-viewer Fit fills the available edge proportionally, including small-image upscaling; use a semi-transparent backdrop without checkerboard and click outside the picture to close. Keep picture/toolbar clicks and drag-to-backdrop safe, with the existing editor zoom limits unchanged. Make the floating footer fully transparent, label its version DEAS v…, and show native backend starting state followed by a once-per-running-transition green confirmation that disappears after 3 seconds, with reduced-motion support.

## Unreleased — 0.1.35

- Move Backend/Logs behind Comfy and repository actions to the header right. Unify backend management, settings and inline provider authorization without redundant navigation buttons; add installed/configured status marks. Rename Owned backend, open read-only media previews by click into the existing zoomable full-window viewer, use 3px outer edges and make the version/update hint float without footer-height reservation. Preserve image-edit gestures and explicit install/job authorization.

## Unreleased — 0.1.34

- Compact Studio/Library/Prompt Forge/Run Plan/Comfy navigation; move branding and utility actions to the footer and installer/authentication under Backend. Media browsing is preview-only with explicit input adoption and retained editor state. Add transform restoration and a visible yellow dashed processing frame; avoid an empty comparison half before a render exists.

## Unreleased — 0.1.33

- Prevent normal window close while a project draft or project operation is pending; allow retry after saving or explicit discard after a failed save. Report listener-registration failure visibly and through fixed, rate-limited native Logs; grant only the local-main destroy API required by Tauri’s close listener. Forced termination and running-job exit consent remain separate work.

- Add native image-draft project folders with revision-checked autosave, exclusive writer locks, explicit create/open/close and managed PNG input. Restore baseline image settings without silently replacing a missing checkpoint or overwriting global Studio defaults; upload a managed input only on explicit Run. This is not job/result persistence, restart recovery or complete SDXL/native-platform acceptance. See [Projects](PROJECTS.md).

## Unreleased — 0.1.32

- H3 Continuity adds explicit native local-video upload (MP4/MOV/WebM/MKV, up to 512 MiB), reusing source-preserving input transport. Upload only fills the returned backend filename; Prepare, Use and Run stay separate. Cancellation/stale replies are guarded, six languages are updated, and upload errors reach bounded redacted shared Logs.

- H3 Continuity prepares an existing backend-input video by explicit relative filename, shows validated metadata, and selects its opaque manifest identity only after Use video. Native generation and Forge accept the video source kind for the first extension, then use produced checkpoints. Imported-parent provenance/canvas/family resolve serial clip pinning without guessing cache IDs; no local upload, playback or preparation-time VAE load.

- Checkpoint-based H3 Continuity reuses Prompt Forge for the next runnable step’s Next action: review/apply, drafts, undo and cancel, exact source/overlap/canvas/duration context, stale-draft protection and plan/run locking while writing. Optional continuity payloads are revalidated natively; imported-video prompting remains planned.

- H3 Continuity can explicitly load the active session’s checkpoints and pin a source clip for the first continuation. Source selection persists with backend identity, enables the first Next action and preserves correct predecessor pinning; no automatic latest-source choice or generation. Source changes keep authored steps/settings and never delete backend clips. Session-list failures now reach bounded shared Logs.

- H3 Continuity accepts explicit named sessions through a validated draft and Apply action. Switching names preserves authored steps/settings and removes only local clip/job links, never backend clips; it does not restore existing checkpoints. The backend-reserved `_imports` session is rejected before generation.

- H3 Continuity exposes the Director overlap choices (73/56/39/22/5 context frames). Optional persisted settings apply only to continuations; omitted settings and first captures retain their previous graph behavior. Native validation rejects unsupported values.

- H3 Continuity moves from the dock to a native modal overlay opened from settings for Text/Image → Video. Existing plans, step execution and clip pinning remain owned by Workbench; close/Escape preserves them. Old Continuity dock selections fall back to Media.

- H3 I2VA/FL2VA/L2VA Prompt Forge: opt-in frame character/order/box assignments and manual Cast Read/edit/Write, reusing the reference controls. First/last-frame identity metadata survives the Forge context; boxes take precedence, and source replacement drops assignments. Video graphs stay unchanged.

- H3 REF2VA Prompt Forge: editable Pose cards with explicit vision Read and the Director's `pose@N` request keys. Cards follow their picture across reference reorder; removed pictures and stale reads cannot contribute a misplaced card. Generation graphs are unchanged; automatic reads remain planned.

## 0.1.31 — 2026-10-19

- Fix release staging: Windows error handling no longer exits unconditionally; new version directories cannot reuse stale assets, target manifests describe the artifacts actually built, and release staging requires a clean source snapshot.
- Fix minimum-size person-box edits so their generated geometry remains valid for the strict Director contract and pack round trips.
- H3 REF2VA **Find people**: explicit vision request, candidate-only results and separate apply; preserve matching character identities, discard stale/cancelled replies, and request scoped best-effort stops. Native request/response validation and sanitized request-correlated logging; no real vision acceptance claimed.
- H3 REF2VA: manual people boxes on character-reference pictures — move/resize, keyboard controls, renumber/remove, Director pack storage and Cast crop identities. Originals stay unchanged. Image-load failures reach shared Logs through a fixed path-free, rate-limited native diagnostic; detection is a separate explicit vision action.
- H3 REF2VA character references: **People & order** selects character identities in tap order plus horizontal, vertical, depth or no spatial order. Forge requests, Cast cards and Director packs retain the selection; changing a picture label clears overrides.
- MiniMax H3 Prompt Forge: seven ordered group labels for reference pictures, automatic character numbering that skips group members, and individual Cast cards for every member. Packs retain group labels; individual labels now cover the Director's Characters 1–32 without changing the nine-picture limit.
- Image editor: images dropped from the Media dock keep their original pixel size (capped at 8192 px) instead of shrinking to a third of the picture.
- Inpaint: outpainting — a source frame outline marks the processed area; pictures can be moved partly outside it, and frame areas no picture covers are outpainted (added to the mask, filled neutral grey).
- Generate: prompt fields are three lines taller and get **Copy** (⧉) and **Clear** (✕) buttons under the expand button.
- Fix "Command plugin:event|listen not allowed by ACL" in the native app when opening the References tab and the Media dock: the main window capability now grants event listen/unlisten, so dropping files from the file manager works there.

## 0.1.30 — 2026-10-19

- Fix late cancelled Forge responses/errors clearing a replacement request, stale Cast reads applying to changed references, and RefMod pack loading/saving after library discovery or without timeline media.
- Image editor: unlock the base image for colour brushes, stroke erasing/clearing, move/resize and visibility; reorder base/inserts or mask rows by drag-and-drop. Run submits changed base compositions as a snapshotted input PNG with the inpaint mask kept separate.

- Fix installation consent being falsely blocked when native folder fields are serialized in a different order; compare Models/Input/Output paths by value.
- Image editor: rename mask overlay to **Opacity (%)**, default 75%; retain saved user values. Regional image prompting is added to the roadmap only, not implemented.
- Fix Windows installation failing at Verify with `AttributeError: module 'signal' has no attribute 'alarm'`: enforce the ComfyUI probe's 120-second limit in the native process runner, retaining cancellation and owned-process cleanup on Linux/Windows.

- Generate references: right-click a Media dock tile → **Add as reference** / **Remove reference** (Multi-reference → Video) or **Use as source video** (Video → Video); entries that the model cannot take (LTX: images only) or that exceed the Director limits (9 images, 3 videos, 3 sound tracks, 12 files) are disabled with the reason. Referenced tiles show an accent border and a badge (`@ 2.5 s` for LTX; the Director's exact prompt labels `<Picture N>`, `<Video N> <Audio M>`, `<Audio N>` for MiniMax H3) in every dock view and on the preview. New media type filter **All / Images / Videos / Audio** beside Sort/View (remembered).
- Generate: new **References** dock tab for Multi-reference → Video — Director lanes, reorder within a lane, remove, LTX Second/Strength, H3 Picture/Sound use, Start/End trims (sent as REF2VA `trim_start`/`trim_end`; 2–15 s checked before Run), **Insert label** into the prompt and a Director limit meter. The settings column now shows only the reference count with **Edit**.
- Generate references: drag Media dock tiles (any type) onto the **References** tab button or the open tab, or drop files from the file manager onto the open tab; drag a card's name onto another card of its lane to reorder. Reference cards are compact (thumbnail beside the name).
- Generate (MiniMax H3): **Input scaling** select with the Director's seven modes for reference pictures/videos (and first/last frames); default stays Fill and crop. New optional intent field `h3.inputScaling`, validated natively against the Director's list.
- Generate references (MiniMax H3): **Save pack… / Load pack (add)… / Load pack (replace)…** in the Director's reference-pack JSON format, so packs move between DEAS and the ComfyUI Director node; **Clear** empties the list. New native commands `native_json_save` / `native_json_open` (OS dialogs, ≤ 1 MiB, JSON only; permission `allow-native-json-file`).
- Generate references (MiniMax H3): **RefMods** — read the backend's RefMod library, add up to 8 with strength and description, insert `<RefMod N>` into the prompt; sent as Director `timeline_data.refmods` and kept in reference packs. New native command `native_h3_refmods` (read-only `GET /dasiwa/refmods`) and optional intent `h3.refmods`.
- Generate (MiniMax H3 video): the prompt hammer is the Director's Prompt Forge for the current run — mode, duration, output canvas and references as the run will use them, Detail/Creativity, Shots with per-shot boxes, Regenerate, **Cancel** and the last three drafts, which cannot be applied once the run settings change. `native_forge` allows the node pack's `cancel` route.
- Generate references (MiniMax H3): Director picture labels (Character 1–9, Place, Style, First/Last frame, Pose, Custom) and per-reference Forge instructions in the References tab; the hammer uses the Director's label writer when all references are pictures and offers **Let the model see the pictures**; labels and instructions travel in reference packs (`forge_label`, `forge_instructions`).
- Generate (MiniMax H3 video): Director prompt helpers inside the hammer panel — **Insert prompt structure**, **Insert [Shot N]**, and **Prefill labels & summary** for REF2VA (labels in node order, RefMods last; fills only empty sections).
- Generate references (MiniMax H3): **More for Prompt Forge** per reference — Description (used by Prefill), Keep and Ignore (sent to the Forge, saved in packs as `forge_keep`/`forge_drop`).
- Generate (MiniMax H3): Director **Cast & scene cards** in the hammer for labelled pictures — Read (vision model) or write a card per Character, Place and Style; filled cards are sent with the draft. `native_forge` allows the node pack's `cast` route.
- Fix: the Media right-click menu closed immediately when the clicked tile was partly scrolled out of view.
- Generate: **expand** buttons on the prompt and negative prompt open a large floating, draggable and resizable editor for long prompts; it edits the same field (Escape/✕ closes).
- Fix MiniMax H3 Image → Video preparation rejecting uploaded `deas-inputs/` reference images: ComfyUI's top-level image combo is not a complete input inventory. Keep path validation and backend-side file checks.

## 0.1.29 — 2026-10-19

- Replace Studio Workspace map with **Run Plan / Ablaufplan**, a live read-only stage/settings/output preview derived from the same image/video intent builders as Run. Show optional image refine/upscale, LoRAs, masks/input preparation, wildcard rules, video-family passes/audio and output choices; label values that only resolve at Run. No workflow editor, runtime tracking, automatic uploads or generation.
- Preserve saved `map` tab selections, the mounted Generate draft/editor, and Engine/legacy workspace diagnostics in an expandable section. Update all six locales, navigation fixtures and Studio guide.

- Docs: consolidated video/reference/Director-parity working plan in `docs/VIDEO-PLAN.md` (reference picking rework, References tab with the Director media view, full H3 Prompt Forge, Continuity overlay, GPU acceptance).

## 0.1.28 — 2026-10-19

- MiniMax H3 **Image → Image / Inpaint** (Director *Image Inpaint* mode via the `fl2va` model): native `MiniMaxH3ImageToVideo` 5-frame pass with the source (or masked crop) as first frame, frame 0 as result, DEAS mask composite; intent `h3Edit {shiftVideo, shiftAudio}`. Plan noted: H3 Continuity planner moves into its own Director-style overlay.
- Generate: **Video → Video** and **Multi-reference → Video** for LTX 2.3 and MiniMax H3. LTX guides with the source video's frames (Source strength) or with image keyframes at chosen seconds and strengths (core `LTXVAddGuide`); MiniMax H3 runs both as DaSiWa Director **REF2VA** with image/video/audio timeline media. `native_input_upload` now also accepts MP4/MOV/WebM/MKV video (≤ 512 MiB, copied to the input root for core `LoadVideo`) and WAV/MP3/FLAC/Ogg/M4A audio. Graphs validate offline against the real ComfyUI checkout; no GPU run yet.
- Slider compare zooms (wheel at the cursor, middle-drag pan, double-click reset) with both pictures in step and the divider fixed. Picking an edit job in the queue without an open draft restores its source picture, Image to Image / Inpaint mode and controls instead of asking to pick an image.
- Inpaint: **Magic wand** tool adds the similar-colour area around a click to the selected mask (Alt+click removes, Tolerance slider); Ctrl+mouse wheel resizes the brush; brush diameter minimum is 1 px; Mask overlay shows its value. Mask Shrink Grow / Mask Blur fields line up (shared label/field/slider rows); the Mask Blur help line is gone. The input picture in the settings column shows its file name without folders.
- Editor: while Image to Image / Inpaint is active, picking any queue entry keeps the editor (masks, controls) beside the result instead of hiding it; the "paint a mask" hint shows only while the editor is visible. Renders and browsed pictures open in a full-window zoomable view on click (wheel zoom, drag pan, Fit/100 %, Escape). The compare **Slider** button moved left beside the edit buttons.
- Generate: generation metadata is no longer a permanent column; a **Metadata** button on the preview opens it as an overlay panel (remembered open/closed). The settings column and the queue are slightly wider; Steps, CFG, Denoise, Mask Shrink Grow and Mask Blur get sliders under their number fields.
- Media: right-click a file → **Open in folder** opens its folder in the system file manager (`native_media_reveal`, permission `allow-native-media`).
- Generate: the pipeline chips became one **Pipeline** dropdown at the top of the settings column. Run blockers (pick an Input/Output image, paint a mask, source outside the model grid) are shown on the preview instead of the settings column, and a **✕** on the preview closes it and drops the selection.
- Dock: a **View** picker switches Media, Models and LoRAs between Tiles, Large thumbnails and List; tile names wrap to two readable lines (models without folder and extension).
- **Post-process** moved from under Run into the preview toolbar and is offered only in Image to Image / Inpaint; before, it could start an image job with a video model.
- Fix side by side after an edit Run: a zoomed editor picture was not refitted into the half column and spilled under the render; the split preview also gets an explicit row so a large render cannot grow it.
- Define Rust-first, atomic/reusable plugin, Linux/Windows, ComfyUI coexistence and performance requirements in project-local contributor rules; consolidate the current implementation plan and real reference-project integration gates.
- Move detailed setup, feature/tab and developer documentation from README into indexed `docs/` guides; add News/Credits and migrate the complete changelog history with a root compatibility pointer. Correct stale video/grid/auth/navigation claims without claiming new runtime acceptance.
- Output names use only hyphens: DEAS video saves (DaSiWa video combine) now publish `-00001-audio.webm` and matching `-first-frame.png`/`-last-frame.png` exports instead of `_00001_audio`, and the returned path follows; the retired `%date_yyyy_mm_dd%` token is rewritten to `%date_yyyy-mm-dd%` in stored templates. Add **Default** buttons to the Output naming and Output format option cards.
- NVIDIA discovery keeps the host driver environment for NVML and captures bounded stdout/stderr with raw process exit diagnostics; add host-environment, Windows-reported query and failure/output-bound regression cases.
- **Image → Image** and **Image → Video** stay selectable without a picked image: the preview then asks for an Input/Output image and Run is greyed until one is picked. Choosing a pipeline the remembered model cannot run picks the first compatible model with its family defaults.
- Editor: the **Insert** button is gone — drag an Input/Output image from the Media dock onto the picture instead. Brush/Erase paint on a selected image layer in its own pixels with a colour field, hex value and palette; painted layers are flattened and uploaded at Run. The mask brush has a black–white value slider (white default); mask layers can be raised/lowered; show/hide is an eye icon; the brush diameter slider is wider. Mask Blur defaults to 4. The audio VAE picker follows the VAE picker instead of sitting among the video fields.
- Post-Processing: opt-in **Tiled refine** — `refine.tiled {tileWidth, tileHeight, overlap}` (model-native tile on the family grid, overlap ≥ 64 px) makes both compilers route the refine sampler through the `DaSiWaTiledDiffusion` MODEL patch (own CFG guider on custom-sigma schedules); the node is a new prerequisite option node.
- Fix the app freezing when **Templates** is opened in the Comfy tab on Linux: WebKitGTK composites ComfyUI's blurred dialog backdrop in software, which pinned the compositor thread at 100 % over the animated thumbnails. The Comfy frame now renders overlays without backdrop blur.

## 0.1.27 — 2026-10-18

- Fix desktop CSP permissions for dock asset fetches and loopback backend video URLs; report fetch/player errors in the caption. Native playback now starts, but an observed GStreamer Matroska demuxer assertion still crashes WebKitWebProcess. Video playback and audible audio remain unaccepted (see verification notes).

- Add **Text → Video** and **Image → Video** for LTX 2.3, Wan 2.2 (image-to-video, high/low split) and MiniMax H3 (DaSiWa Director/Guide, T2VA/I2VA/L2VA/FL2VA). The native `video-generation` intent is compiled per family from the owner's DaSiWa workflow wiring; family data (`builtin.json`) carries encoder/VAE patterns, defaults and fps. Seconds/FPS snap frames to each model's grid; an image's **Last frame** button sets the closing frame; LTX offers an optional 2-/3-pass latent upscale chain.
- Options tab: **Output format** card (DaSiWa Enhanced Video Combine codec/container/bit depth/quality/audio, first/last-frame PNGs, image saver PNG/WebP + compression) and **Chunking (video)** headroom (KJNodes feed-forward chunking). Both compilers accept `imageFormat`/`imageCompression` for the image saver.
- **Continuity** dock tab for MiniMax H3: planned segments with seconds and next action, run one or all; the first take is captured, later steps pin the previous clip via the read-only `native_h3_session` command. New `native_input_upload` copies dock references into the backend input folder (`deas-inputs/`).
- Native prepare checks every video node and the models/encoders/VAEs/images per family; history `gifs` entries become outputs with their MIME type and play in the stage through the backend's `/view` URL — WebKitGTK rejects `<video>` on the `asset://` protocol with `FormatError` before any request, verified with a WebKitGTK probe against the real H3 AV1/Opus WebM. The Media dock's own video/audio preview in the stage had the same defect since it was added; natively it now plays a blob of the asset bytes (one fetch per selection, revoked on change). Graphs validated offline with ComfyUI's `validate_prompt` (`tools/validate_video_graphs.py`); no real model run yet. No new dependency.

## 0.1.26 — 2026-10-18

- Use hyphens in default output dates, sanitized model names and saver counters; remove the underscore before the extension. Upgrade only the former default template, preserve custom templates and standalone Comfy naming, and avoid overwriting existing clean filenames.

- Add Generate's **Post-Processing** dock tab (SwarmUI Refine / Upscale): opt-in second pass after every Run with Refiner strength, Upscale factor (grid-snapped) and an optional upscale model (`UpscaleModelLoader` + `ImageUpscaleWithModel`); **Post-process** under Run applies it alone to the shown render or edit source.
- Rename the edit mode Resample to **Image to Image**; the Refine and Upscale edit modes are replaced by the tab. Both compilers validate the new `refine`/`upscaleModel` intent fields and check upscale models against the backend's v3 combo list. Verified with a real SDXL run on a throwaway ComfyUI (512×768 → 2× RCAN → 1024×1536 refine; Post-process 1024×1536 → 1536×2304). No new dependency.

- Trust the system certificate store for LLM and backend HTTPS (`rustls-tls-native-roots` alongside the bundled roots): endpoints signed by a private/LAN CA such as a self-hosted Ollama behind a LAN reverse proxy failed with `UnknownIssuer` and surfaced only as "LLM server unavailable". OpenAI-compatible base URLs get `/v1` appended when missing (the node pack's rule), so `https://host` and `https://host/v1` both work instead of returning HTTP 404. Saving or refreshing the LLM backend now reloads the Prompt Forge tab's and the hammer's model lists, which previously kept the list from before the change.

- Repair CI blockers without weakening checks: retain the locale-safe sigma placeholder, use fixed-size EXIF byte chunks accepted by current Clippy, restore valid catalog selection after Installed view, and integrate the existing model-cache safety fix with its Linux/Windows regression tests. Preserve the last API-probe error when the readiness deadline expires, with a deterministic malformed-then-stalled fixture.
- Bound Prompt Forge responses while streaming, reload its model list on backend/environment changes and discard late replies. Native inpaint preparation now checks every emitted crop/blur node before submission; regression tests cover these review fixes.
- Add beginner-oriented Windows/Linux build, launch, first-setup and troubleshooting instructions to the README.
- Make Prompt Forge find models in the configured models folder (`llm` added to the generated extra model paths). Fix CI: Linux tests run with a private `TMPDIR` (folder guards reject shared `/tmp`), the Forge reload test no longer races a thumbnail call, and release binaries build on Ubuntu 22.04 for older glibc.
- Prompt Forge: a 405 (ComfyUI's GET-only static route answering a missing node-pack route) now shows the node-pack upgrade hint instead of a bare status, and every Forge failure is written to Logs. The Prompt Writer route ships in DaSiWa nodes 0.5.30. CI: Windows Clippy no longer fails on a Linux-only test helper; workflow actions moved to their Node 24 majors.
- The **Models** and **LoRAs** docks show a subfolder tree (built from the scanned names, like the media navigator) that filters the tiles; the pick is kept per tab and the tree only appears when the folder has subfolders.
- The hammer's LLM mode starts from the current prompt **plus the active wildcard picks**: with Presets & Wildcards active, DEAS asks the node pack (`POST /dasiwa/wildcard-preset-prompt-builder/build`, DaSiWa nodes 0.5.31) for the resolved positive string of the saved seed/reroll and appends it to the idea. Auto-reroll runs still pick again at run time.
- Windows: canonical paths no longer carry the `\\?\` prefix (`dunce`, already in the dependency tree), so reopening an existing environment works and ComfyUI gets plain `--output-directory`/model paths; Windows test expectations follow the canonical form.

## 0.1.25 — 2026-10-18

- Add persisted output naming to Generate Options with `%type%`, `%date_yyyy_mm_dd%`, `%time%`, `%seed%` and `%model%`. Default to type/date/time-seed-model below Output; preserve saver counters/extensions and immutable per-job values.
- Validate resolved relative paths in both compilers; reject traversal, unresolved variables and Windows device names. Existing saved Options remain compatible. No new dependency or video recipe.

## 0.1.24 — 2026-10-18

- Add Generate's **Presets & Wildcards** dock beside LoRAs and a two-mode hammer entry alongside LLM Prompt Forge. Read the installed node's actual library; select presets/wildcards, weights, style, seed and per-side estimated token budget. Keep selections/rules across navigation and restarts; activation defaults off.
- Preserve manual/Forge base prompts and execute the original DaSiWa wildcard node before both text encoders. New Picks rerolls alternatives; Random Select explicitly replaces the selection; optional per-generation reroll preserves selected subjects. Show active/disable controls and immutable submitted rules in job metadata. Feed actual node strings to the metadata saver so PNG parameters contain the prompts used.
- Verify bounded native library transport, capability gating, compiler/UI tests, six-language/five-width browser IPC fixtures using the real library, and direct original-node/PNG-saver execution without models or a live-service restart. No new dependency or node-pack modification.

## 0.1.23 — 2026-10-18

- **Prompt Forge.** A hammer in the Generate prompt field writes or enhances the prompt in the selected model family's dialect (Illustrious/SDXL, Anima, Krea 2), with review, Apply and one Undo; in Image to Image and Inpaint it sends the source picture (input or output folder) to a vision model, and a model without vision writes from the text with a notice. A new **Prompt Forge** tab beside Generate adds Wan 2.2, LTX 2.3 and MiniMax H3 (T2VA/I2VA/FL2VA/L2VA/REF2VA, Duration, Shots, labelled reference pictures), Detail/Creativity, vision reading of input-folder pictures and **Send to Generate**.
- No second implementation: DEAS forwards to the DaSiWa node pack's Prompt Writer (`/dasiwa/llm/write`, new in 0.5.30) and H3 Forge routes through the native `native_forge` command, which allows only those routes and fills in the LLM endpoint saved in DEAS. Families name their dialect in `src/families/builtin.json` (`forge`).

## 0.1.22 — 2026-10-18

- Inpaint: add opt-in **Inpaint only masked** with **Mask Shrink Grow** (0–512 source pixels, default 8 when enabled). Crop to the visible masks plus context and blur support, process at the active model's pixel budget with model-grid-aligned dimensions and crop aspect, then resize back and composite at the original coordinates. Existing image layers stay underneath; source files are never changed.
- Add **Mask Blur** (0–31 source pixels, default 0/off), using the same Gaussian kernel and sigma as SwarmUI for both the latent noise mask and final composite. Both features use existing ComfyUI core nodes, without installing a node pack.
- Validate the extended intent in both compilers, preserve the old graph when disabled, and snapshot crop/blur with the mask before asynchronous upload. Verify with real browser mask pixels and real ComfyUI CPU crop/blur/composite operations, not GPU generation.

## 0.1.21 — 2026-10-18

- Linux: render on the GPU again. The old `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1` default forced WebKitGTK into CPU rendering, which made zoom, tab switches and the inpaint editor sluggish; the real failure it worked around (Wayland protocol error 71 on NVIDIA) is avoided with `__NV_DISABLE_EXPLICIT_SYNC=1` instead. `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1` still works as an explicit override.
- Media tiles of animated WebP/GIF files (ComfyUI video outputs) now show a still first frame. Live animated tiles kept three WebKit decoder threads and the whole window repainting as long as the dock was visible (~30% of a core), which dragged every control down.
- Linux: opening a video no longer crashes the app on hosts without `gst-plugins-good`, where WebKitGTK aborted because `autoaudiosink` was missing and could not demux MP4/WebM. DEAS (x86_64) bundles those GStreamer 1.20 plugins and enables only the ones the host lacks.
- Library: **Catalog · Installed** are now tabs (like Studio's Generate · Map) and the catalog view gets a **Catalog source** selector (only **DaSiWa** for now). The SFW/NSFW switch and preview blur are gone; every entry is always shown, 18+ items keep their tag.
- Ticked files now stay selected across cards and categories. A **Selected for download** overview lists them with their target folder and a remove button. The **Download all (n)** button at the top right replaces Prepare plan + consent + Start: it plans every provider/folder group natively and runs them one after another. A blocked plan, failure or cancel stops the run and keeps the remaining files selected.

- Add **Open in Comfy** to embedded image/video workflow metadata. The explicit action switches to the existing owned-backend editor and imports a named workflow without queueing generation; the previous unsaved workflow remains available. Require a running backend, validate the editor graph and show import/timeout failures. API-only prompt metadata retains the existing settings action, not a fabricated editor graph.
- Use a narrow, origin/source-checked all-frame editor bridge without native-command permissions or backend modifications. Verify Chromium and WebKitGTK imports against the real frontend; Windows runtime remains unverified.

## 0.1.20 — 2026-10-18

- Extend the existing Generate image editor with cursor-anchored zoom, Fit/100%, panning, selectable image/mask thumbnails, visible-only layer submission, image reordering and selected-image move/resize handles. Add up to four independent repaint masks, a shared numeric/range brush diameter, round/square brushes, active-mask erase/clear and preview-only mask opacity. Masks remain source-sized and merge to the existing native PNG upload contract.
- The brush shows its real shape and zoomed size as the pointer inside the view; tools (Select/Brush/Erase/Pan) and brush shape are icon buttons, and brush, mask and overlay controls appear only in Inpaint.
- Preserve edit drafts through edit-mode, result and Studio/map navigation; add Return to edit draft. Snapshot mask pixels and image geometry before asynchronous upload. Reject model-grid-incompatible inpaint source sizes instead of silently rounding, and reject failed/stale insert image loads without guessed geometry. No new drawing dependency, execution schema or backend lifecycle change. Opaque insertion and ephemeral drafts remain limitations.
- Browser evidence uses real canvas pixels and fixture IPC, not model inference. Native WebKitGTK interaction and new GPU-generation acceptance remain unverified; see VERIFICATION.md for results and independently reproduced baseline failures.

## 0.1.19 — 2026-10-18

- The footer version checks once per launch, read-only, whether a newer DEAS GitHub release exists and whether the owned ComfyUI or DaSiWa-nodes checkout is behind its upstream branch (`git ls-remote` against the checked-out HEAD). A pending update shows `v… ↑` with the list in its tooltip; clicking opens the release page for an app update, otherwise the Backend view with its Upgrade button. Nothing is downloaded or installed automatically.
- The header button **Settings & Backend** is now **Backend**.
- Image post edits in the Generate preview: floating **Resample · Refine · Upscale** buttons over an Input/Output image or a finished result make it the image-to-image source and open that mode's controls in the settings column (Resample = the existing scaling + denoise, Refine = same size at its own denoise, default 0.25; Upscale = factor 1–4, each edge snapped to the model grid, lanczos resize before encoding, denoise default 0.35). Output images are loaded in place through ComfyUI's `name [output]` annotation, so nothing is copied into the input folder. **Inpaint** paints a mask directly over the image (brush size, Erase, Clear; denoise default 0.8): the mask is uploaded natively as a fresh `deas-masks/<uuid>.png` into the backend input folder, only the painted area is resampled (`SetLatentNoiseMask`) and the result is composited onto the untouched source pixels (`ImageCompositeMasked`) — verified on a throwaway CPU ComfyUI: pixels outside the mask are bit-identical. **Insert** adds up to four extra images from the Input/Output folder as layers over the source (pick in the Media dock; drag to move, corner to resize with aspect kept, arrows / + / − / Delete on the focused layer); they are pasted in source pixels by ComfyUI (`ImageScale` lanczos → `ImageCompositeMasked`) before resize, encoding and any inpaint composite, opaque (alpha ignored). The inpaint nodes are now in the backend capability list, so preparation no longer rejects an inpaint job. A finished edit shows original | edited split with a draggable divider; **Compare** toggles it. The footer no longer says "No cloud account. No background requests."
- New `release.yml` workflow: a `v*` tag builds `deas-linux-amd64`, `deas.exe` and the NSIS installer and attaches them to a GitHub Release, which is what the footer check reads.

- Add Comfy beside Library: the original editor and installed custom-node frontend extensions from the running DEAS-owned backend, in an isolated frame. Hide the app header and other panels while keeping the tab band and footer. Preserve the editor and Studio across tab switches; no additional backend, installation or automatic job submission. A changed backend endpoint reloads the editor; Stop, failure or lost native status revokes it. Comfy shows a waiting/loading spinner until the backend/frame is available; the Backend header button reports Starting… or ✓ Started from native status. The Studio execution-only contract remains intact with this explicit standalone-editor exception.

## 0.1.18 — 2026-10-17

- LLM settings sit right of Startup optimizations and configure only the optional external endpoint. Local language GGUFs from the configured models folder's `llm` directory remain available independently of Ollama/OpenAI-compatible server configuration or availability; projector files are excluded. The combined discovered model list feeds the test selector and shared per-request prompt-feature contract. No global model/path/fallback selection: local llama-cpp execution and CPU/GPU offload selection are automatic, and failures never silently switch the selected model. Older endpoint settings remain readable without retaining their old global model defaults.

## 0.1.17 — 2026-10-17

- Qwen Image 2.1 Turbo runs on the schedule saved in its checkpoint: a `qwen-image-2.1-turbo` family (same header as the base model, told apart by `turbo` in the file name; base-family LoRAs stay available) carries the eight `sample_sigmas` from the official ComfyUI template, both compilers emit `ManualSigmas → SamplerCustomAdvanced` (with `RandomNoise`, `CFGGuider`, `KSamplerSelect`) instead of `KSampler`, and the Workbench shows the Scheduler as `CUSTOM` with Steps following the schedule (image-to-image keeps its tail like AlignYourSteps). The Options tab gets a **Custom sigmas** field that shows the schedule in use, is editable for any model, and a preset list of the known schedules (Qwen Image 2.1 Turbo); the typed text (`studio.run.options.sigmas`, validated like `ManualSigmas`) overrides the model's own. Validated against real ComfyUI `validate_prompt`; no generation run yet.
- Sampler/scheduler pickers read the backend list once the endpoint is known instead of on the first click, so the first popup already shows every sampler (the native select opened before the fetched list arrived).
- Settings & Backend adds a shared LLM service: local llama-cpp-python, Ollama or an OpenAI-compatible chat API, persisted separately in `deas-llm.json`, with an explicit test completion and reusable prompt-feature caller. An unavailable configured server can fall back to the selected local GGUF; authentication, model and malformed-response errors remain errors. Local context/GPU layers are explicit and the worker exits after each request. No automatic downloads, external-service management or API-key authentication. Full PromptForge writing and model-specific prompt workflows remain separate work.

## 0.1.16 — 2026-10-17

- Media separates folder navigation into a left-hand panel: expand/collapse folders without changing the selected folder, click a folder name to browse it, and use the ancestor path or parent button to go back. Child folders load on demand with local errors and retry. Media tiles now contain files only; name filtering and sorting do not hide or reorder the folder navigator. Browsing remains read-only.

## 0.1.15 — 2026-10-17

- Settings & Backend adds **Startup optimizations** for the owned backend: attention (PyTorch, Comfy Kitchen, Sage, Flash), the explicit `--fast` features `fp16_accumulation`, `fp8_matrix_mult` and `autotune` (never a bare `--fast`), high VRAM (off by default: it turns off ComfyUI's Dynamic VRAM), reserved VRAM, VAE fp32/bf16/CPU, and under Advanced diffusion-model precision, fp16 text encoder, smart-memory/dynamic-VRAM off and the node cache mode (classic, none, LRU size). Three presets: **Speed+** (default when nothing is saved: Comfy Kitchen INT8 attention, fp16 accumulation and kernel autotune; Comfy Kitchen only on NVIDIA SM 7.5+, because ComfyUI exits on older cards, so those get autotune only; small numerical differences, not bit-identical), **Compatibility** (autotune only: identical math on any NVIDIA GPU) and **Optimizations off** (ComfyUI's own defaults). CPU environments resolve every preset to no flags. Presets are stored by name and resolved against the installed GPU at every start; editing any control turns the choice into Custom. Stored in `deas-startup.json` beside the environment. Only allowlisted flags are accepted, conflicting groups are rejected natively, and options whose package is missing from the venv (sageattention, flash_attn) stay disabled; a package removed later fails the start instead of the job. Apply saves and restarts a running DEAS backend, but not while a job is queued or running. A stopped backend picks the options up on its next start. fp16 accumulation moved here from the per-job Options tab, so it no longer needs KJNodes. Async offload is not offered (ComfyUI already enables it on NVIDIA/AMD), nor `cublas_ops` (no wheels, source build against the exact Torch/CUDA only). The VAE default is explained: ComfyUI picks per VAE type and GPU. Real run: ComfyUI accepted `--use-ck-attention --highvram --async-offload --bf16-vae --fast fp16_accumulation fp8_matrix_mult autotune --reserve-vram 1.5 --cache-lru 8` and produced a coherent SDXL image.
- Native metadata reading covers videos: `prompt`/`workflow` container tags from MP4/MOV (QuickTime `mdta` keys, `use_metadata_tags`, moov at either end) and Matroska/WebM global tags — exactly what core SaveVideo/SaveWEBM, VHS Video Combine and the DaSiWa Enhanced Video Combine write and what civitai.com reads from videos. Bounded (8 MiB metadata, element budgets), streamed/unknown-size segments and truncated files keep the tags that precede the clusters. Verified against ffmpeg-generated fixtures mirroring Civitai's own set and a PyAV-written DaSiWa-style file.
- Metadata column gets **Use these settings**: an explicit button that puts a selected job's intent or a local image's embedded generation data (A1111 `parameters` incl. `<lora:…>` tags, SwarmUI params, or a ComfyUI API graph — from images and videos) back into the Generate controls — prompts, seed (fixed), steps, CFG, sampler/scheduler, exact size, and the checkpoint/LoRAs only when the models folder holds them (full name, else basename). A1111 sampler names are translated to ComfyUI ids (`Euler a` → `euler_ancestral`, `DPM++ 2M Karras` → `dpmpp_2m` + `karras`, `Schedule type:` honoured); what cannot be translated or is not on this backend/in the models folder is listed under the button as *Not carried over* instead of guessed. Nothing is applied without the click; metadata without generation data shows no button.
- Generate gets an **Options** dock tab beside LoRAs with per-job speed/memory patches, compiled into the graph (no backend restart) and offered only when the running backend lists them: attention backend (core `ModelAttentionBackend`: PyTorch or Comfy Kitchen INT8; KJNodes Sage modes), full or tiled VAE (256–1024 px tiles; image-to-image also encodes tiled), step cache (core EasyCache/LazyCache, default threshold 0.05; Spectrum H3 listed but disabled until an H3 video recipe exists) and torch.compile (inductor/cudagraphs). Choices persist; submitted options appear in the metadata column. Real run on SDXL 1024², 20 steps, RTX 5090 (single runs, no benchmark): every option except Sage (package not installed here) executed; EasyCache 0.05 skipped 7/20 steps (1.74 s vs ~2.5 s without cache); no reliable attention speed difference was measured. The nodes' own 0.2 threshold destroyed SDXL output, and torch.compile cannot trace the Comfy Kitchen kernel, so DEAS never sends both together. Sage modes are listed by KJNodes even without the `sageattention` package; such jobs fail with that error.
- Generate seed controls add Random/Fixed, exact ±1 stepping with wraparound, New without changing mode, Use last and a ten-entry deduplicated submitted-seed history with restore/copy. Manual edits and restores select Fixed. Seed, mode and history persist locally. Preparation/submission errors do not add history. The existing safe-integer seed contract remains unchanged (0–9007199254740991); full unsigned 64-bit values are not supported.

## 0.1.14 — 2026-10-17

- Generate shows a scrollable metadata column between preview and queue: submitted prompt/negative prompt, model, output dimensions, seed, steps, CFG, sampler/scheduler, separate encoder/VAE, LoRAs and image-to-image input/denoise. Selecting another queue job switches its immutable native snapshot; editing current controls never changes previous job metadata.
- Execution date and generation duration come only from matching ComfyUI history event timestamps; unavailable values are omitted. DEAS version is included. No guessed attention backend, automatic-VAE flag or preparation timing. The same column reads embedded metadata from browsed and OS-dropped local images: PNG text (including compressed/Unicode chunks), JPEG comments/EXIF and WebP EXIF/XMP. Swarm parameters are expanded into fields, ComfyUI API graphs into node settings, and A1111/unknown text is retained verbatim. No image files or active controls are changed.
- Civitai-ready outputs: when the backend lists the DaSiWa Metadata Image Saver and Config nodes (installed with the Director/Output package), both compilers save through them instead of core `SaveImage`. The PNG then carries the A1111 `parameters` chunk (prompt, negative, steps, sampler/scheduler, CFG, seed, size, model name and AutoV2 model hash, `<lora:name:weight>` tags) beside ComfyUI's `prompt`/`workflow`; civitai.com matches resources only by hash, so plain `SaveImage` output shows settings but links no model. Verified against `@civitai/generation-metadata` 0.4.0 (the parser civitai.com uses) with a real CPU run. Core-only backends keep `SaveImage` unchanged.

## 0.1.13 — 2026-10-17

- Generate now offers Director-style aspect and resolution selectors: automatic reference aspect, landscape/portrait/square and ultrawide ratios, custom aspect, one model-derived native/default resolution, pixel-budget presets through 4K, custom megapixels and exact width/height. Explicit dimensions override the aspect selector until a preset or aspect is chosen again. Auto-Aspect is offered only in media-input pipelines, never text-to-image/video. The proportional aspect swatch is inside the picker; no separate size-summary row. Old 768px-native preferences migrate to model defaults.
- Image-to-image keeps resolution controls beside Denoise. Input scaling supports Off, Auto (2048px short-edge downscale cap), Target/stretch, Fit, Fill and crop, and Fit and pad. Scaling is compiled before VAE encoding on both native and preview paths; Fit or original-size pass-through can differ from the selected canvas. Original files are never rewritten. Settings persist and reference dimensions are read from loaded image/video previews.
- Fix: every job ended as "Unknown — Backend prompt/client/graph correlation failed". ComfyUI rewrites FLOAT inputs (`1` → `1.0`) in the stored graph, and DEAS compared graphs byte-exactly; numbers now compare by value, everything else stays exact.
- Live progress: running jobs show the sampler step (`3/8`) and the latest ComfyUI preview image in the stage and on the queue tile, read over the job's own `/ws?clientId=` socket (`preview_method: auto` per job, plain `http` endpoints only). The preview is display-only, never a saved output.
- Diagnostic jobs accept aligned dimensions through 8192px per side with a 16,777,216-pixel area cap; required scale/pad nodes are checked before submission. This is a validation bound, not a model/VRAM guarantee. Video and multi-reference generation recipes and automatic multi-model chaining remain unavailable.

## 0.1.12 — 2026-10-17

- **Pipeline** chips above the settings: Text → Image, Image → Image, Text → Video, Image → Video, Video → Video, Multi-reference → Video. Only what can actually run is enabled: Text → Image needs a checkpoint; Image → Image additionally needs an image picked from the environment's **Input** folder (ComfyUI's `LoadImage` reads only there) and shows a **Denoise** control instead of width/height — the job then goes through `LoadImage → VAEEncode` and is validated against the backend's input-file list. The video pipelines are listed but disabled with the reason until a verified recipe exists.
- Studio has one **Generate** tab (no separate image/video areas; the recipe will follow the loaded model later) beside the workspace map. Checkpoints and LoRAs are read straight from the environment's models folder (the one set in Settings) as soon as an environment is open, with Reload; picked LoRAs are chained into the job (`LoraLoader`, strength for model and CLIP). Basic settings (width/height/steps/CFG, sampler/scheduler, seed with new/lock) and one green **Run**. Prompts and settings are remembered. Without an open environment **Load models** asks the running backend instead.
- Run is the authorization: it prepares and submits one immutable native plan (validated against the running backend) and polls until done; finished files are shown straight from the output folder (native PNG transfer when no environment is open). Director/video recipes are still not implemented.
- The workbench fits the window: settings on the left, the preview takes the remaining height with the prompts under it, the session queue sits on the right with the green **Run** under it, and a bottom dock with **Media · Models · LoRAs** tabs can be dragged taller at its top edge (height remembered). Resizing the window never adds scrollbars.
- **Media** dock: thumbnail tiles (real miniatures for images, glyphs for video/audio/folders) in a wrapping grid, clicking loads the file into the preview. The path is clickable segments, the listing looks into subfolders (**Depth** 1–5, default 3; symlinked and hidden folders are not descended), starts in the environment's **Output** folder (newest first) with **Output / Input** chips honouring the folders set in Settings, and re-lists after a finished generation. **Models** and **LoRAs** docks show tiles (CivitAI preview when cached beside the file); a click picks the checkpoint or toggles a LoRA with its strength field.
- Media performance: PNG tiles use native 192 px thumbnails cached in the app cache directory (decoded once per file, keyed by path + size + mtime; other formats fall back to the original), only the visible tile rows plus two spare are rendered, folder listings and thumbnails are cached for the session (revisits show instantly, then refresh), and listing/thumbnailing run off the UI thread. The dock tab row has a **search** box and a **sort** select (Newest · Name · Size; Newest for media only) that apply to Media, Models and LoRAs; folders stay first.
- The owned backend's automatic endpoint handoff no longer jumps to the workspace map; only the explicit **Inspect existing backend** opens the Engine node.
- **Model families** (SwarmUI-style detection, data-only plugin `src/families/builtin.json`): the models scan reads each safetensors header — `modelspec.architecture` first, then tensor-key signatures — and falls back to the cached CivitAI base model. Built in: SDXL/Illustrious/Pony, Anima, Krea 2, Qwen Image 2.1, MiniMax H3, LTX 2/2.3, Wan 2.1/2.2, ACE-Step, SAM 3. The **Models** dock now lists every model from `checkpoints`, `diffusion_models` and `unet` with its family; only models with a recipe for the active pipeline are selectable (others are greyed with the reason). Picking a model applies the family's starting settings (size, steps, CFG, sampler, scheduler). Diffusion models (Anima, Krea 2, Qwen Image 2.1) run through `UNETLoader` + `CLIPLoader` (family CLIP type) + `VAELoader`; matching text encoders and VAEs are found by file name and offered as **Text encoder** / **VAE** pickers. The **LoRAs** dock hides LoRAs of other families (unknown ones stay).
- Sampler and scheduler offer every choice the backend lists (read on first use of the picker), both here and in the diagnostic panel; native validation checks them against `object_info` instead of a fixed three-entry list. Model and input-image names with spaces and non-ASCII letters (`MM-H3 - Ahegao Face.safetensors`, `Größe/…`) now work in jobs; only traversal, absolute/host paths, URLs, `\ : %`, control characters and padded segments are refused — such files are skipped instead of failing the whole prerequisite check.

## 0.1.11 — 2026-10-16

- Header buttons are smaller with their ✓ inline before the name. **Provider authorization** shows a ✓ plus the providers whose saved token passed the identity check (re-checked on start and when leaving the panel). The AiO installer pulses red until a backend is installed.
- **Settings & Backend** (renamed): after an install it holds the autostart switch next to the owned backend controls, now with **Restart** (stop, then start) besides Start/Stop.
- Library always lists every model; in SFW mode 18+ previews are blurred instead of hidden, and the 18+ switch only un-blurs (no reload).
- Technical logs are read line by line and cleaned: ANSI colour codes and control characters are removed, progress-bar carriage returns keep the last state, UTF-8 is no longer split between chunks and empty lines are dropped.

## 0.1.10 — 2026-10-16

- Installed model sizes use localized GiB/Gio labels; Python cache files are excluded from Git.
- Choosing a completed DEAS environment previews a checked reuse operation instead of attempting to reinstall into it. **Use existing environment** verifies the captured native manifests, ownership and launch-file fingerprints; the new-install overwrite guard remains intact. The folder chooser recognizes an environment root rather than adding a second `deas-environment` subfolder.
- The last successful/explicitly opened environment is validated and reopened after app restart. Its owned backend auto-starts by default; **Settings → Auto-start backend** persists the opt-out. Turning it off never stops a running backend, and explicit Stop does not trigger an automatic restart.
- Backend startup first checks current native status, remains session-scoped and uses an OS-held environment lock to prevent duplicate DEAS instances from starting the same environment. No foreign service is adopted or stopped; API readiness is not generation readiness.

## 0.1.9 — 2026-10-16

- Language follows the system language automatically (first bundled match of the OS/webview languages, English otherwise) and is only stored when the user picks one. The selector moved from the header into **Settings**; a pick is marked **Custom** with the detected system language named, and the first entry returns to automatic.
- Library **Show: Catalog · Installed** switch: *Installed* scans the environment's ComfyUI models folder (standard category subfolders, recursive) and lists the files as cards per folder. Opening a card shows path, size, SHA-256 and a **Fetch CivitAI metadata** button: the file is hashed once, looked up via `api/v1/model-versions/by-hash`, and model/version name, base model, trigger words, preview and the showcase image's sampler/steps/CFG/size are cached beside the file as `<file>.deas.json` (also when CivitAI does not know the hash).
- Provider authorization: the provider dropdown is replaced by an overview of buttons (Hugging Face · CivitAI · GitHub) showing ✓ / "Token saved" or "No token" each; clicking one opens its framed settings below.
- Fix: CivitAI checkpoints listed no files — real download URLs carry `?fileId=<n>`, which the native URL guard rejected for the whole listing. Files now load, show their variant (precision · size · format · ≈GB), and loading/errors appear under the clicked card.
- Library sort is an inline `Sort by  Newest ↓  Name ↑` button pair: the active one is highlighted, clicking it again flips the arrow and direction (undated items stay last).
- Clicking a Library card opens its file picker directly under the card. CivitAI files are grouped by model version (native `Resource.version`): pick a version chip, then tick the quant/format files of that version.
- Installation status, logs and Cancel moved to the left column under the tabs with a spinner while running; it stays visible on every tab during the run.
- Setup layout: AiO installer, Provider authorization and Settings are buttons right of the headline; the tab band holds **Studio** then **Library** (the "Explore studio" toggle is gone). The installation review shows only on the installer view and hides after a successful install (a second installer click reopens it for a re-run); success switches to Studio.
- Remembered choices: `src/lib/preferences.ts` (`usePref`/`readPref`/`writePref`, validated JSON under `deas.pref.*` in webview storage). It restores the install folder (only while its `deas-install.json` exists, otherwise the first run returns and the entry is forgotten), the Library category, base family, media filter and sort, and the Studio sub-tab.
- Provider authorization automatically checks saved/restored tokens on opening or changing provider, and new tokens after saving. A green checkmark requires a successful authenticated identity response from Hugging Face, CivitAI or GitHub. Rejected tokens, unavailable checks and unsupported providers remain distinct; Refresh retries without re-entering the token.
- Checks use fixed HTTPS identity endpoints, bounded native-only requests and no redirects or plaintext/token readback. Token replacement/removal and panel navigation discard stale verification results. Authentication does not imply download entitlement or license acceptance.

## 0.1.8 — 2026-10-16

- Authorization remembers tokens in the OS credential store by default (session-only opt-out), restores saved official-provider tokens on app start and displays their status automatically. Library browsing reuses the matching configured token unless anonymous access was explicitly selected; no plaintext fallback.
- Selected folder aliases resolve to their real existing directories at the chooser boundary; installation execution still refuses symlink substitutions.
- Safe environment data relocation: Settings separates path-only saves from an explicit **Move files & save folders** action with all-tree conflict/overlap checks, exclusive streamed copy, byte verification, atomic settings save and unchanged-source removal. Collisions abort, never overwrite. Linux only; other platforms fail closed.

## 0.1.7 — 2026-10-16

- Library sorts catalog cards and loaded file rows by publication date (newest first) or name (A–Z).
- No-clobber folder relocation groundwork with atomic tmp+rename settings saves (`deas-settings.json` beside the environment root).

## 0.1.6 — 2026-10-16

- Simplified automatic setup: one page asks only for the storage folder and the optional Director package (checked by default); backend, optional packages and the ComfyUI Git ref live under Advanced options. The native plan re-prepares automatically after each edit; **Start install** is the single explicit authorization.
- Removed the manual step-by-step installer, draft save/restore and the guided confirmation suites.
- Setup UI is a top tab strip (Installer with pending-glow/done-check, Provider authorization, Library, Settings) with a sticky Review & edit panel; the review never scrolls out of sight.
- Studio start page: Video / Image / Map tabs with a `MediaLibrary` side panel — native read-only folder listing, OS and browser drag & drop, asset-protocol previews. Registered as the `media` plugin.
- Library (renamed from Optional downloads): preview cards grouped by ComfyUI model folder, Models tab with image/video filter, base-model chip filter (Anima, Illustrious, Krea 2, LTX 2.3, MiniMax H3, Wan 2.1/2.2), `18+` badges, in-app NSFW confirmation dialog and light-switch toggle, local-present rows, in-place managed staging into `ComfyUI/models/<category>`, CivitAI search browsing, full owner catalog (`darksidewalker.toml`).
- Settings tab: per-environment models/input/output folders honoured by the owned backend at start (`--input-directory`, `--output-directory`, generated `deas-models.yaml`); a vanished saved folder fails the start.
- Provider token page opens in the system browser (`native_open_token_page`, allowlisted URLs only).
- Windows support compiled: managed uv/Python provisioning, Job-Object backend lifecycle, TCP-table listener ownership, anchored no-clobber downloads/PNG export, NSIS bundling, CI workflow. No Windows runtime acceptance.
- Root build scripts `build-linux.sh` / `build-windows.cmd`; uniform breathing bubbles; one panel open at a time.

## 0.1.5 — 2026-10-15

- Diagnostic PNG output transfer: bounded non-redirecting retrieval of indexed outputs of the current succeeded native job, full CRC/dimension-checked decode, original bytes + SHA-256 session cache, local Blob preview and native Save As of the cached original (no-clobber, unsafe parents/symlinks refused).

## 0.1.4 — 2026-10-15

- Diagnostic classic job transport: native intent revalidation against fresh prerequisites, immutable plan, separate unchecked consent, one-shot classic `POST prompt`, prompt/client/correlated status tracking, explicit current-session job recovery after navigation. No global interrupt, no silent retry.

## 0.1.3 — 2026-10-15

- Installation-to-studio continuation: successful native provisioning reveals the studio automatically (no second enable step); the studio binds the exact running owned backend endpoint once per lifecycle; backend Start/Stop stay explicit, `generationReady` stays false.

## 0.1.2 — 2026-10-15

- Recipe prerequisites: explicit read-only core `object_info` probe, exact checkpoint/sampler/scheduler identities, missing-node reporting, DEAS-owned diagnostic compile preview; endpoint edits discard stale evidence.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-10-14

- Automatic-first setup: read-only native defaults (new `deas-environment` beside the executable, NVIDIA profile gates, explained CPU fallback), editable findings/plan summary, immutable-plan invalidation on edits.
- Linux startup fallbacks: process-local `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1` and `GDK_BACKEND=wayland,x11` defaults before GTK/WebKit init.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-13

- Alpha studio: React/Tauri single-page neural interface (`NeuralBlob`/`NeuralPath`/`NeuralGraph`), trusted built-in plugin manifests, read-only ComfyUI discovery.
- Native Rust AiO provisioning (uv, managed Python, ComfyUI checkout, pinned CPU/NVIDIA Torch, Director package with Forge/RefMods/Continuity/Output), immutable plans, explicit consent, owned backend lifecycle with FD/socket-inode ownership proofs.
- Real CPU/NVIDIA installation and owned lifecycle acceptance on Linux (RTX 5090 CUDA computation).
