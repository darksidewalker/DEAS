# DEAS plan

[Documentation index](README.md) · [Project rules](PROJECT-RULES.md) · [Product decisions](PRODUCT-DECISIONS.md) · [Verification journal](VERIFICATION.md) · [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

This is the **single current plan** for DEAS: what is in place, what is still open and what has to be proven before an item counts as accepted. It replaces the earlier `IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md`, `VIDEO-PLAN.md`, `YUE2-MUSIC-PLAN.md`, `PLUGIN-ROADMAP.md`, `NEXT-SESSION.md`, `DRAFT-VIDEO-PLAYBACK-FIX.md` and the old milestone checklist that used this file name; they remain in Git history.

- Delivered work is described in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) (per version) and the user guides; evidence lives in the [verification journal](VERIFICATION.md). Finished slices are not repeated here.
- [PROJECT-RULES.md](PROJECT-RULES.md), [COMFYUI-RULES.md](COMFYUI-RULES.md) and [EXECUTION-CONTRACT.md](EXECUTION-CONTRACT.md) govern how work is done; [PRODUCT-DECISIONS.md](PRODUCT-DECISIONS.md) governs scope.
- An open row here is **not** authorization to start it. New integrations and large slices need an explicit owner priority.

Current source: **0.2.0 BETA** (unreleased), previously ALPHA. The label does not close any acceptance gates below. Last published baseline: **0.1.66** (tag `v0.1.66`), reviewed 2026-10-29.

## 1. Evidence levels

An item is only as accepted as its strongest evidence. Keep the levels separate when updating this plan.

| Level | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Implemented, bounded | Code exists for the named slice; it does not mean the whole area is done |
| Fixture-verified | Unit/component/HTTP/Chromium fixtures or offline graph validation passed |
| Native Linux | Exercised in the real GTK/WebKitGTK (or libmpv) app on Linux |
| Real model | Actual model computation produced a checked artifact on named hardware |
| Windows runtime | Exercised in the real WebView2 app on Windows; a cross-build is not this |

**Cross-cutting open gates.** Most delivered slices are fixture-verified and many are native-Linux verified. Unless a slice says otherwise, these remain open product-wide: Windows/WebView2 runtime acceptance, real-model quality/performance per family, measured RAM/VRAM/idle resources, and native click-through on hosts where input automation is blocked (KDE Wayland ignores XTest).

## 2. Status by area

## 3. Owner scope

Current scope (see [product decisions](PRODUCT-DECISIONS.md)): the lightweight global recent-job history is delivered; managed generated-PNG adoption, immutable i2i revisions and full persistent-project recovery are **deferred**. Integrations delivered since that decision (MOSS, image references, TVE, learned latent upscale, GGUF, YuE2) were each explicitly prioritized by the owner. There is no automatic “next slice”: pick from §4 only on explicit owner priority.

## 4. Open work

### 4.1 Video, H3 Director and playback

- **Continuity enable/disable: native acceptance.** The **Continuity active** switch landed in 0.1.67 (frontend-only; intents unchanged, see [Studio](STUDIO.md)). Open: native Linux WebKitGTK and Windows WebView2 click-through.

- **Paste and replace-on-paste for references (W2b′).** Clipboard files have no path; this needs a new native byte-upload command (sniffed, size-capped, written to `deas-inputs/`), which is a trust-boundary change of its own.
- **Trim editor remainder.** Whole-crop move: needs two finite endpoints, preserves the 2–15 s span, clamps to `[-start, 3600-end]` and updates both ends atomically (3600 is a safety bound, not source duration). The Director's keys move the playhead (Left/Right ±1 s, Shift ±0.1 s); do not call trim nudges Director parity. Waveforms and thumbnail strips.
- **Create RefMod (W2e3).** Offer the Director's *Create RefMod*: encode selected references via the node pack's `DaSiWaH3RefModExport` into `models/refmods` so they appear in `/dasiwa/refmods`.
  - [ ] Source-check the node signature, required H3 VAEs, input kinds and output naming; no pack patching from DEAS.
  - [ ] Separate export intent/graph, validated offline like `dump_video_graphs`; explicit Run, cancellation checked before any write.
  - [ ] **Create RefMod** on selected references with the Director's strength/name semantics, six locales; refresh the RefMod library afterwards.
  - [ ] Component/native/offline-graph tests; real H3 VAE encoding and GPU time separately.
- **References in the main view (W7).** Multi-reference already uses the References modal. Still open: the Image → Video start image, the first/last-frame pair and the Video → Video source as stage slots with replace/remove/drop, keeping `refs`, `lastFrame` and the intent shape unchanged.
- **Join clips and H3 transitions in Continuity (Director parity gap).** The Director's Continuity row has **Join clips…** (`docs/h3_continuity.md#join-exported-clips`): (a) *Continuity segments* — assemble ready exports of one session into one video without loading a model (**Select chain to here**, superseding full-timeline exports); (b) *Video files* — join uploaded/timeline videos with trims, optional lossless packet copy, re-encode H.264/AAC otherwise; (c) *H3 transitions* — one short H3 sampling run per cut with `context_frames` guides from both neighbours. Nodes: `DaSiWaH3ClipAssemble` (`assembly_data {version:1, rows:[{kind:'media'|'checkpoint',…}], repair_transitions:false, audio_policy:'preserve', copy_video}`), `DaSiWaH3TransitionGuide` + `DaSiWaH3TransitionRender` (`transition_data {version:1, rows:[a,b], context_frames:22, transition_frames}`), all listed in the pack's `__init__.py`. DEAS Continuity (`ContinuityPlanner.tsx`, `jobs_video.rs`) emits only Prepare/Decode/Publish; `H3_CONTINUITY_NODES` does not contain the three join nodes, so the owner must switch to the Comfy tab to assemble. **Status: planned, not implemented.** Owner request.
  - [ ] Source-check the three nodes' signatures, `assembly_data`/`transition_data` schemas and the 24-fps/SDR/`yuv420p` media constraints; pin the JSON contract in a Rust test like the Director timeline contract.
  - [ ] Continuity overlay gains a **Join clips** section: session segments (chain selection from `native_h3_session` clips, export coverage check) and video files (Media picker, order, trims, copy-video switch), with the preflight duration/mode summary before Run.
  - [ ] Optional **H3 transitions** per cut (context/transition frame counts, defaults 22/29 as the Director), emitted as Guide → existing sampler → Render → Assemble; separate `videoPost`-style product (no Continuity checkpoint mutation).
  - [ ] Unchanged: Prepare/Decode/Publish graphs, Continuity plan shape and `continuity` intent when the section is not used; intent gains an optional `h3.join` block only.
  - [ ] Native validation + prerequisites (`H3_CONTINUITY_NODES` + join nodes only when used), offline graph validation (`tools/validate_video_graphs.py`), UI tests, six locales, STUDIO.md; one real join (copy and re-encode) and one real transition run on a throwaway backend.
- **Later recipe features (W6).** LTX keep source audio (audio VAE encode + 3-D noise mask), LTX IC-LoRA control (`iclora_parameters` on core `LTXVAddGuide`), LTX per-segment prompts (GPL Prompt Relay patch, explicit opt-in only), LTX retake, source-fps resampling, H3 Image Inpaint as its own pipeline label, Wan T2V/S2V, per-model Wan LoRA lists. Unplanned ideas: colour transfer, seamless loop, watermark/soundmark, NAG, TritonVAE.
- **Real GPU acceptance (W5).** On a throwaway ComfyUI on another port (never the owner's backend): one LTX v2v, one LTX keyframe run, one H3 REF2VA with a 2–15 s clip, one H3 image edit with and without mask. Record outputs, time, VRAM and visible quality. Questions: does H3 frame 0 carry the edit; is unresampled LTX source fps acceptable; does `VAEDecode` after `LTXVSeparateAVLatent` decode H3 correctly.
- **Learned latent upscale.** Real model quality/performance; strict baseline-first preservation for the paired Original/Processed outputs.
- **Playback acceptance.** On Linux, embedded libmpv has replaced the old WebKit/GStreamer path (and its Matroska crash) for all Workbench video. Still open: libmpv runtime acceptance (audible audio, A/V sync, seek/EOF/reopen, resources), WebView2 video on Windows, and WebKit `<audio>` (music/FLAC, audio references) with the bundled GStreamer plugins. Keep `src-tauri/gstreamer/`: the plugins are compiled in via `include_bytes!` and serve `<audio>`.

### 4.2 Video post-processing (TVE) and paired products

Rules: ComfyUI keeps model-dependent work; Rust owns inspection, source retention, recipe compilation and validation. When optional post-processing is enabled the user gets **two real encoded products** (unprocessed baseline and processed result), both selectable/exportable and kept after failure/cancellation; the imported original is preserved. No extra lossy round trip just to save the baseline.

Owner decisions 2026-10-30: (1) the TVE tab compiles the same ComfyUI post recipe the pipelines use (`video-enhance`: LoadVideo → upscale model / `DaSiWa_RTX_UpscalerRefiner` / `DaSiWa_RTX_FrameGeneration` or core RIFE → `DaSiWa_EnhancedVideoCombine`) on the owned backend; (2) the standalone Rust ONNX engine (`video-upscale` feature, `ort`, worker process, output draft/preparation/binding) is retired — it duplicated a strict subset of the backend chain under ≤512 px/≤10 s limits. Shipped in 0.1.67 (see STUDIO.md "TVE post-processing on the backend"): pipeline `videoPost` with B7/7 paired products, all combine codecs/containers/bit depths, model selectors from `upscale_models`/`frame_interpolation`, queue/preview/export through the shared session. 0.2.7 adds the TVE panel's own job polling (a submitted job no longer stays "Queued" while the Studio queue is closed), the RTX `use_mmap`/frames-per-chunk controls and a truncated-safetensors check in the model scan. Open: real GPU acceptance of each stage on the owned backend (RTX nodes need the installed `nvidia_vfx` SDK), HDR, restoration beyond SDK denoise/deblur, baseline-before-processed ordering (PP1 applies to the video savers too), and exact processed geometry in the first/last-frame PNG check (accepted at decoded size).

- [ ] **PP1 strict ordering.** Paired image refine products ship (0.1.51), but sibling savers do not enforce baseline-before-refinement; a failure before the baseline saver runs can leave no baseline.
- [ ] **Paired-video acceptance.** Baseline boundary per chain; both products in results/library/compare/export with six-language role labels; decoded readback (dimensions, frame count/timing, audio, colour/bit depth); measured RAM/VRAM/throughput per platform.

Reference: TrueVideoEnhancer `67ddb2508fdb6da7f1897bbd964f316592f762d0` (`backend/custom_pipeline.py`, `streaming_pipeline.py`, `render_contract.py`, `nvidia_vfx_pipeline.py`) is a behavioural reference only. Its rawvideo path loses source PTS, its host budgets exclude GPU tensors and its final publication lacks a cancellation check. GPL code reuse does not clear model, NVIDIA SDK or FFmpeg terms.

### 4.3 Music (YuE2)

Delivered in 0.1.66 (see [MUSIC.md](MUSIC.md)). Open:

- [ ] Cover source preflight: actionable no-audio-stream error and decoded-PCM memory bounds for the input (only output FLAC is bounded today).
- [ ] Live-backend SheetSage2 list multiplicity with real weights.
- [ ] External-backend FLAC export: `jobs_outputs_tests.rs::music_flac_outputs_are_decoded_before_preview_and_export` covers fetch/decode/no-clobber export; confirm it runs without `outputRoot`, then close.
- [ ] Real Text to Music (Full/Melody/Off), audio and video covers, scoped cancellation.
- [ ] Native FLAC playback on WebKitGTK and WebView2; Windows runtime.

Constraints kept from the implementation plan: signatures from one checkpoint do not cover every YuE2 variant (unknown variants stay unavailable; no filename fallback); missing optional nodes disable only the affected modes; no transcription, voice cloning, extra codecs, cloud fallback or automatic installer changes.

### 4.4 Image: masking, references, regional prompting

- **SAM 3.1 masking (planned).** Text → mask and click/box → object mask via core `SAM3_Detect` (`CheckpointLoaderSimple` → `CLIPTextEncode` → `SAM3_Detect` with `bboxes`, `positive_coords`/`negative_coords`, `threshold`, `individual_masks`; `SAM3_VideoTrack` later). Preferred over SAM2 + GroundingDINO (two packs, two models). DEAS already detects `sam3` checkpoints but has no pipeline for them. Limits: text prompts ≤32 tokens; the weights `sam3.1_multiplex_fp16.safetensors` are under the custom SAM License (license inventory and explicit download consent first); VRAM is unmeasured.
  - [ ] Recipe `sam3-mask` returning a new editor mask layer (never overwriting masks); both compilers and `recipe_prerequisites` list the node and checkpoint.
  - [ ] Prompt field plus click/box tool, mapped through the brush's source-pixel transform.
  - [ ] Missing model/node shows the install path; real run with measured time/VRAM.
  - Frontend-only follow-ups: select-all-similar colour (non-contiguous wand), edge stop (gradient barrier).
- **More reference techniques.** SDXL IP-Adapter (external `ComfyUI_IPAdapter_plus`; consent/license check first), Flux Redux via core style-model nodes, edit models (Flux Kontext/Flux.2/Qwen Image Edit) through their own reference nodes, OS-file drops onto the prompt, and video/audio chips reusing the H3 reference contract. Unsupported families must explain why instead of ignoring references.
- **Regional prompting (planned).** Opt-in regions (name, positive and optional negative prompt, strength, rectangle or painted mask), SDXL first; the global prompts stay. No enabled region means an unchanged graph.
  - [ ] Prove a two-region SDXL recipe on the owned backend first (`ConditioningSetArea`/`ConditioningSetAreaPercentage`/`ConditioningSetMask`/`ConditioningCombine`) against a fixed-seed baseline; record placement, leakage, latency and VRAM.
  - [ ] Typed region data in `execution.ts` and native validation in `jobs.rs`; required nodes in `recipe_prerequisites.rs`; families in `builtin.json`; bounded payloads and in-bounds geometry.
  - [ ] Region editor via Workbench and `StudioImageEditor`; text-to-image needs an output-sized canvas; region masks stay distinct from inpaint masks.
  - [ ] Coordinates against the generation canvas through zoom/pan/resize/crop-inpaint/refine; snapshot before uploads; Run Plan/metadata/preset serialization.
  - [ ] Compiler parity tests, UI tests and a real artifact per advertised family; six locales and guides.

### 4.5 Models

- **User-defined recipe profiles (M-02, planned).** M-01 (the Edit meta… family override) shipped in 0.1.66. M-02 would add:
  - a versioned, data-only local profile binding an unknown model to an existing recipe adapter, with exact VAE/encoder references;
  - adapter-supported defaults/constraints and explicit supported modes;
  - a stable profile ID, with revalidation when components are replaced;
  - distinct states *Configured* / *Backend requirements checked* / *Successfully executed*;
  - optional bounded import/export (no credentials or weights).

  A genuinely new architecture still needs a reviewed adapter. A later *Import example workflow…* may only assist the mapping; it must never execute arbitrary graphs.
- **Split diffusion models for checkpoint-only families (planned).** The Studio checkpoint selector and the Models tab list YuE2 only as an all-in-one checkpoint in `checkpoints/`: the family has `"loader": "checkpoint"` and its header rule needs both `model.diffusion_model.llm2vae.weight` and `text_encoders.model.embed_tokens.weight` (`builtin.json`, `model_families.rs`). A diffusion-only YuE2 file in `diffusion_models`/`unet` is therefore never listed. ComfyUI core already supports the split form (inspected at `b1a247c9`): `UNETLoader` detects it from `vae2llm.weight`, `llm2vae.weight`, `latent_pos_embed.pe`, `model.layers.0.self_attn.qkv_proj.weight` and `time_embedder.mlp.0.weight` (`model_detection.py`), `CLIPLoader` has type `yue2`, and `VAELoader` recognizes the YuE2 audio VAE (`sd.py`). (A file in a misnamed `checkpoint/` folder is not scanned by ComfyUI or DEAS; that is a placement problem, not this gap.)
  - Correct pipeline use comes first: list a loading form only where it really runs through Text to Music **and** Cover Music. Verify each supported form end-to-end — detection, Run Plan, compiled graph, SheetSage2 cover path, decoded FLAC result — before advertising it; a listed but non-working form is a defect, not partial support.
  - Detect diffusion-only YuE2 files by those header keys and list them in the selector and Models tab for Text to Music and Cover Music, alongside the existing checkpoint form.
  - Compile a split music recipe (`UNETLoader` + `CLIPLoader type=yue2` + `VAELoader`) with header-backed companion matching for the text encoder and VAE slots, missing-companion Run gates and unchanged graphs for the all-in-one checkpoint.
  - Apply the same audit to other families that are checkpoint-only today but whose core loaders accept split files; GGUF split variants follow the existing GGUF rules.
  - Native/TS compiler regressions, offline graph validation, six locales, then a real run per loading form in both music pipelines: the all-in-one checkpoint (including a quantized one such as `convrot_int8`, whose loading/quality is unverified) and the split files; MUSIC.md and the family table updated.
- **GGUF.** Real bounded image/video/audio-in-video GGUF inference and the Windows runtime. ComfyUI-GGUF has no full-checkpoint or GGUF VAE loader, so a manual family assignment can still fail on unsupported labels.

### 4.6 Studio UX

- **Startup splash (artwork and acceptance open).** The splash (`public/splash.html`, `src-tauri/src/splash.rs`) shows the wordmark and real phases, keeps main hidden until the restore settles, has a 30 s hand-off deadline and a reduced-motion bar. Open:
  - Owner-provided Catgirl idle animation into `public/splash/` (`catgirl.apng` preferred, `catgirl.webp`, static `catgirl.png` also used for reduced motion); do not substitute artwork.
  - Acceptance beyond the Linux XWayland probe (fresh environment): warm start with a remembered environment, slow/failed restore, disabled autostart, Wayland-native and Windows.
- **Global search (landed in 0.2.7, open).** The magnifier entry in the top tab band, Ctrl+K, the breadcrumb result list and reveal/flash of controls are implemented over the curated index in `src/lib/search.ts` (`GlobalSearch.tsx`); a disabled control reports its own tooltip first, then the entry's reason key, then the generic greyed note. Open:
  - Native acceptance on WebKitGTK and Windows: overlay placement at narrow widths, focus return after Escape, flash under reduced motion (Chromium at 1440/900/480 px and reduced motion are verified in `docs/VERIFICATION.md`).
  - The index is a curated set (Studio settings/prompts/dock incl. Presets and Wildcards, Forge prompts and ladders, Chat, TVE post incl. frame-rate multiplier, Run Plan stages, Library catalog+installed incl. scan scope, Comfy iframe, Backend panes/folders/language, Logs filters/actions); extend it only where a control has a stable anchor.
- **In-app spellcheck (landed in 0.2.8, acceptance open).** `spellbook` checks prompt fields on every platform against the pair installed under Backend → Language (`spellcheck.rs`, `src/lib/spellcheck.ts`, `PromptTextarea`); the WebView/Enchant path is gone. Open:
  - Native acceptance of the underline overlay (font/line metrics mirror) on WebKitGTK and WebView2, including resized Studio panes and the enlarged editor; the engine itself is verified with fixtures and the pinned pairs.
  - A personal "add to dictionary" list for recurring prompt vocabulary (`photorealistic`, model names) is not implemented; such words are flagged.
  - Fields outside `PromptTextarea` (Comfy iframe, Forge card/layout captions, Chat history) are not checked.
- **Queue statistics expansion.** Client-measured elapsed queued/running time for live rows (marked as client-side) and steps/seed/checkpoint in the detail view; no new tracking.
- **Monitoring tab (landed in 0.2.9, open).** Generations (last ten finished attempts from the recent-history store with queue wait, generation time and timeline bar) and System (native `/proc`/Win32 + `nvidia-smi` sample per second, 60-sample graph). Open: native acceptance on WebKitGTK and WebView2 (canvas repaint cost at 1 Hz, narrow widths); Windows values (`GetSystemTimes`/`GlobalMemoryStatusEx`) are compiled but unverified on a real machine; disk I/O rates, AMD/Intel GPUs and the node pack's `/dasiwa/system-monitor` route (would add non-NVIDIA GPUs when the backend runs) are not read; the Queue panel keeps its rows (this tab supersedes the "Queue statistics expansion" row above).
- **Wizards tab (planned).** A top-band tab with "EZ wizards" that pick model, pipeline and settings themselves; the user supplies only media, a mask (optional) and a short instruction. A wizard checks the installed models against its preference list and, when nothing fits, offers the Library download (consent + license as today) instead of failing silently. Internally a wizard builds an ordinary image/video intent (`buildImageIntent`/`buildVideoIntent`) and runs through the shared Run/queue/preview — no new execution path; the Run Plan shows the chosen model and values. Order of research/implementation: (1) **Replace** a character/object/characteristic in an image or video: images via Qwen Image Edit 2.1 (`nativeImageReference` method `qwen-image-2.1`, already compiled) or inpaint with mask; optional SAM 3.1 text→mask (§4.4) for the masked area; videos via H3 image edit per first frame + I2VA or LTX v2v with keyframe guides — research which gives the better replacement (owner's guess: H3) and record the fixed-seed comparison before choosing the default. (2) **Mood / colour / emphasis overhaul** of an image: prompt built from Prompt Forge presets and wildcard preset mixtures (`wildcard_preset_prompt_builder.md`, DEAS presets `studio-presets.md`) plus a small curated list of cinematic/colour-grade preset mixtures, run as low-denoise i2i with the family's refine defaults. **Status: planned, not implemented.** Owner request.
  - [ ] Wizard definition = data (preferred families/models in order, pipeline, settings, prompt template, needs-mask flag), not code per wizard; unknown models never guessed.
  - [ ] Replace wizard for images (Qwen Edit → inpaint fallback), then videos after the H3-vs-LTX comparison is recorded in VERIFICATION.
  - [ ] Mood wizard with preset picker and a before/after Slider result (existing paired-products presentation).
  - [ ] Download suggestion path reuses Library consent/license dialogs; no automatic downloads.
  - [ ] Unchanged: Studio tabs, intents and graphs; a wizard run is an ordinary job in the queue.
  - [ ] Tests: wizard→intent mapping per family, missing-model suggestion, mask handling; one real run per wizard; six locales, STUDIO.md.
- **Project persistence (deferred).** The full target, if resumed:
  - complete Studio authoring state;
  - managed inputs, adopted results and job records;
  - an extension of the versioned `project.json` (no parallel schema);
  - one portable ZIP with credentials and weights excluded, and safe extraction;
  - reopening without computation.

  Existing draft projects stay as they are.
- **Native acceptance still open for shipped UX slices:**
  - star/unstar round-trips (Unicode, collisions, permissions, restart);
  - column resizing and the remembered session;
  - Quick Settings resets and project/global isolation;
  - LLM-setup routing from every entry point;
  - Settings dropdown rendering and dependency-warning clearing in WebKitGTK/WebView2;
  - contained bottom media controls (U-02).

### 4.7 Library and downloads backlog

- One flow per card (selection, destination, Prepare, consent and Start inside the picker); one-click single-variant download.
- Exact sizes (HEAD/Content-Length) and a free-space check in the plan.
- Per-version browsing beyond the 50-file listing cap; mark cards whose files are already local.
- Variant labels (quant suffix, size) for Hugging Face/HTTP sources; grouping exists only for CivitAI.
- Resumable downloads.

### 4.8 Installer, backend and distribution

- AMD/Intel profiles and preflight; multi-GPU selection (`install_torch.rs` refuses more than one GPU today); free-space estimates.
  - ROCm startup rules, from research (2026-11-01, no AMD hardware here): never offer `--fast fp16_accumulation` on ROCm — PyTorch applies `CUBLAS_COMPUTE_16F` only under `#ifndef USE_ROCM`, so it is a GEMM no-op, but ComfyUI still sets `PRIORITIZE_FP16` and picks fp16 over bf16 for UNet/text encoder (black/overflowing output on Flux/Qwen-class models; ComfyUI PR #9258 enabled it for AMD untested). Keep Speed+ NVIDIA-only (`startup.rs` already does). Offer `--force-fp32`/`--bf16-unet` as the first diagnostic for GGUF noise on RDNA3 (city96/ComfyUI-GGUF #300: noise on GPU, correct on CPU, 7900 XT/XTX, root cause open) and `--disable-smart-memory` for the ROCm 7.15 / torch 2.13 weight corruption (ComfyUI #15314, black frames). ComfyUI-GGUF has no dequant-dtype switch; there is no documented "fp16 accumulation bug with GGUF on AMD" beyond these two separate facts.
- Git bootstrap, or removal of the external Git prerequisite; full FFmpeg/attention-extension provisioning.
- Interrupted-install repair/resume; staged environment upgrade with rollback (reinstall replaces the venv, which is not rollback).
- Pin the DaSiWa node-pack ref. It is cloned from `main` with the revision recorded but not user-selected, which falls short of the explicit-updates decision.
- Settings relocation on Windows (`settings_move.rs` rejects non-Linux).
- **Selective backend updates: native acceptance.** Implemented in 0.1.67: Update asks Everything / DEAS app only / ComfyUI and node packs / PyTorch only (see [Studio](STUDIO.md)). Open: a real Linux run of each action (a PyTorch update needs an environment with an older profile) and Windows separately. The compatibility blockers named below need no extra gate today: owned environments cannot carry attention extensions (sage/flash/radial plans are refused), ComfyUI-GGUF is pure Python and is reinstalled under the new constraints, and TVE's ONNX runtime is a user-chosen native library outside the venv. Node packs DEAS did not install block the update. Original spec:
  - **Update ComfyUI**: ComfyUI checkout, installed node packs and their Python dependencies, under the existing Torch constraints so a node-pack requirement cannot silently replace Torch. No DEAS binary download.
  - **Update PyTorch**: only to a newer profile this DEAS build knows (`install_torch.rs`), never an arbitrary latest wheel. Offer it only when the new profile's hardware/driver gate passes, and block it when ComfyUI, the installed node packs or DEAS features are not known to work with it (e.g. attention/CUDA-extension pins, GGUF, the CUDA ONNX runtime used by TVE). Show the exact from → to versions before confirmation.
  - Both: stop the owned backend first, block while a job runs, reuse the existing plan/consent/cancellation/log paths, persist the updated plan only after the verify step passes, and report the previous state on failure (no rollback is claimed until staged updates exist). The full **Update** stays available.
  - Acceptance: fixtures for each action alone, failed verify (plan unchanged), a node-pack requirement that would change Torch, unsupported hardware for a new Torch profile, cancellation; a real Linux run of each action; Windows separately.
- **Packed release assets (planned).** Linux `deas-linux-amd64.tar.gz`, Windows `deas-windows-amd64.7z`.
  - Detect packing by magic bytes (`1f 8b` for gzip, `37 7A BC AF 27 1C` for 7z).
  - Verify the archive digest and size first.
  - Extract exactly one entry with the expected executable name: reject paths, dirs, symlinks and extra entries, and bound the decompressed size. Then apply the existing header and atomic-replacement checks.
  - Raw assets stay accepted in both directions (old updaters with new releases and the reverse).
  - Fixtures for raw, tar.gz, 7z, extra/symlink/traversal entries, decompression bomb, digest mismatch and mixed releases.
- Signed/update-verifiable distribution, fresh-machine/Git-free setup, glibc portability and current CI readback.

### 4.9 Reference-project ports

These are the local reference repositories; their functionality does not count as implemented in DEAS. Each port needs an explicit owner priority, a Rust-first native boundary and its own Linux/Windows acceptance.

- **Video comparison:** `<workspace>/DaSiWa-simple-video-compare` (Rust/Tauri/libmpv: `src-tauri/src/native.rs`, `embedded.rs`, `embedded_windows.rs`, `runtime.rs`, `desktop/src/model.ts`).
  - Share the player/probe/runtime boundary with DEAS's libmpv player.
  - One/two-source side-by-side, wipe, blend and difference; seek, frame-step and source audio.
  - Test mismatched dimensions/fps/duration, short-source EOF and missing audio.
  - Filters normalize to `yuv420p`, so this is not bit-exact HDR analysis.
  - Assess GPL/libmpv/FFmpeg redistribution first.
- **Video assembly:** `<workspace>/DaSiWa-simple-rtx-video-assambler` (`vid_tool.py`; spelling retained).
  - A Rust FFmpeg plugin: ordered sources, labels, grid layouts (contain/cover/stretch), audio selection/mixing, NVENC AV1/SVT-AV1.
  - Do not port its defects: the preview only computes resolution, the audio mix assumes every input has audio, the `p8`/`p9` presets are not universal, and `-y` plus timestamp names can overwrite files.
  - Spatial grid and temporal montage are separate contracts.
- **LoRA training:** `<workspace>/DaSiWa-TrainFlow` (`internal/trainer/profiles.go`, `config.go`, `defaults.go`, `musubi.go`, `manager.go`, `normalizer.go`).
  - Profiles: Anima, SDXL/Pony/Illustrious, LTX 2.3, Wan 2.2, Krea 2.
  - Rust owns datasets, typed config/argv, process groups, progress, cancel/resume and result indexing. Python stays the sd-scripts/Musubi engine, in an isolated environment.
  - The runtime uses cu130 (not the README's CUDA 12.4); ROCm is experimental; Musubi is single-process. Replace whitespace-split extra args with typed argv.
- **Full TVE parity**, beyond §4.2: AI/NVIDIA restoration, RIFE/NVIDIA interpolation and SDR→HDR, each only for tested combinations. The reference stack is CUDA-specific and must not become a universal environment.

Node-pack features and their intended DEAS destination (not yet planned in detail):

| Node-pack feature | DEAS destination |
| --- | --- |
| H3 Cache / Kitchen Attention | Opt-in inference optimization profiles |
| RTX Upscaler & Refiner | Enhancement plugin with an explicit NVIDIA SDK requirement |
| Watermark Overlay | Editor overlay |
| System Monitor | Native telemetry |
| Random String Picker | Prompt/seed services |
| Node Status Switch | Planner stage enable/bypass |
| LLM/VLM Analyze | Analysis/captioning plugin |

A PromptForge port keeps per-model dialects, structured video sections, reference labels, tagger integration and review/apply. It uses DEAS's execution layer rather than its own ComfyUI queue, and licensing is verified first.

### 4.10 Plugin platform and planner

`PluginManifest` holds identity/parent/text/node/include/suggest metadata; `validatePlugins` checks duplicates, missing parents and cycles. A manifest alone cannot install or run an implementation.

- [ ] Extend the smallest contract the first real new plugin needs: schema version, dependencies, capabilities/platforms, permissions, lifecycle, settings/locales, tests.
- [ ] Durable project/asset/recipe/job identities and immutable revisions before claiming restartable multi-pipeline editing.
- [ ] Shared job scheduling and scoped recovery across plugins (today: session-held jobs and serial H3 sequencing).
- [ ] Post-setup feature add/remove/update without resetting projects.
- [ ] A trusted built-in versus untrusted extension boundary before loading downloaded executable/UI plugins.
- [ ] A general editable planner (operation graph, revisions, downstream invalidation, review/pause/resume), only once real consumers need it.

### 4.11 Known defects and audits

- The Comfy tab's integrated view is sometimes blurry (scale factor / CSS sizing). Not yet investigated.
- Chat's `read_guide` cuts every guide at 16,000 characters (`forge/assistant.rs`). Most of [STUDIO.md](STUDIO.md) and the Presets/Wildcards sections of [PROMPTING.md](PROMPTING.md) are therefore unreachable from Chat, and MUSIC/TVE/APP-UPDATES are not offered at all.
- `src-tauri/src/output_naming.py::prepare` wraps core/DaSiWa saver methods. This global-patch compatibility exception needs an audit under the [ComfyUI rules](COMFYUI-RULES.md).
- `src/lib/setup.ts` still carries the guided-setup state machine used by core tests and the `existing` plan route; delete it only together with those tests.

## 5. H3 Director and video reference facts

Re-check after node-pack updates.

- **Recipe reference:** the owner's DaSiWa workflows (LTX *OmniForge*, Wan 2.2 *FastFidelity*, MiniMax H3 *MythicAlchemy*; not in this repository) define the wiring. ComfyUI templates and `comfy_extras/nodes_*.py` are only for node signatures. Read subgraph-promoted widget values (e.g. H3 steps 4, shift 10/3, `euler`).
- **MiniMax H3 Director** (DaSiWa node pack: `nodes/nodes_minimax_h3_director*.py`, `js/minimax_h3_director.js`):
  - Modes `T2VA, I2VA, FL2VA, L2VA, REF2VA, Image Inpaint`. `ref2va_model` serves REF2VA and `fl2va_model` the rest. There is **no video-to-video mode**.
  - `timeline_data` items: `{id, type, value, slot, order, enabled, trim_start?, trim_end?, media_mode?}`.
  - Lanes: images 0–8, video 0–2, audio 0–2. Limits: ≤9 images, ≤3 videos, ≤3 audio, ≤12 files. Audio needs an image or video (RefMods count as visual). Clips are 2–15 s; video and audio totals ≤15 s each.
  - Image Inpaint: one image in slot 0, no mask input, a 5-frame pass; frame 0 is the result.
  - All Forge routes return 409 while a workflow is queued.
  - HTTP routes used by the Director: `/upload/image`, `/view?type=input`, `/dasiwa/refmods*`, `/df_h3_continuity/*`, `/dasiwa/h3/forge*`, `/dasiwa/llm/write`, `/dasiwa/input-images`.
- **WhatDreamsCost LTX Director** (GPL-3.0): its guide step equals core `LTXVAddGuide` per segment. Do **not** emit its nodes: they are GPL, its timeline strings come from a 469 KB JS UI, and `/video_ui_custom_view` (arbitrary file read) and `/video_ui_upload_chunk` (path traversal) are unsafe.

Decisions (keep unless the owner changes them):
1. H3 Video → Video and Multi-reference → Video both run **REF2VA**; label it honestly. A REF2VA checkpoint is recommended (a hint, not a block).
2. LTX uses core nodes only (`LoadVideo`, `GetVideoComponents`, `ImageFromBatch`, `LTXVAddGuide`); Wan gets no v2v/ref2v.
3. H3 image edit uses the native node the Director calls, so DEAS masks, crops and layers keep working; frame 0 is the result.
4. DEAS drives node-pack features over their existing HTTP routes. New routes are node-pack work first (route + test + version bump there), never patched from DEAS.
5. Director prompt tokens (`<Picture N>`, `<Video N>`, `<Audio N>`, `<RefMod N>`) stay English in every locale, because they are model input.

## 6. Maintaining this plan

- When a slice lands: record the evidence in [VERIFICATION.md](VERIFICATION.md), the user-facing change in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)/[NEWS.md](NEWS.md) and its guide, then **remove** the finished item here (or narrow it to what is still open). Do not keep delivered narratives in this file.
- Never promote source inspection, a form field, offline graph validation or an HTTP success to real inference, playback or platform acceptance.
- Gates:
  - frontend: `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run build`, `npm run test:layout`;
  - native: `cd src-tauri && cargo test --locked`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo fmt --check`;
  - video graphs: `cargo test --lib dump_video_graphs -- --ignored --nocapture`, then `tools/validate_video_graphs.py <json> --comfy-root <checkout> --extra-model-paths-config <yaml>`. This proves node names, inputs and link types only.
- Documentation-only changes need link/anchor/diff checks, not a version bump.
