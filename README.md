# DEAS — Dark Engine AI Studio

A Rust/Tauri desktop workstation for ComfyUI and DaSiWa tools: generation, model-aware prompting, model/resource browsing and image editing in one interface. Studio, Library, Prompt Forge, Chat, TVE, Run Plan and the original Comfy editor share the same owned backend; installation, provider authorization and settings live in the Backend tab, diagnostics in Logs.

**0.2.3 BETA.** Linux CPU/NVIDIA provisioning and individual model runs are recorded; Windows builds do not establish Windows runtime acceptance. Image, video and YuE2 music recipes exist; Linux video plays through embedded libmpv, but real-model quality and native playback acceptance are still open. TVE enhances videos through the owned ComfyUI backend (upscale model, NVIDIA RTX refine, frame generation); synchronized comparison, assembly and training are planned integrations, not completed ports. See [current status and limitations](docs/PLAN.md).

## Install and start

Check [official releases](https://github.com/darksidewalker/DEAS/releases) for platform-specific downloads and instructions. GitHub's **Download ZIP** is source, not an installed application. The beta is not a signed universal portable release.

To build from source, first install Git, Node.js 22/npm, Rust and the [Windows/Linux prerequisites](docs/GETTING-STARTED.md#before-you-start).

**Linux:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/darksidewalker/DEAS.git
cd DEAS
bash build-linux.sh
./artifacts/deas-linux-amd64
```

`bash build-linux.sh --release` stages the release set under `artifacts/releases/v<version>/`: the Linux binary, deb/AppImage bundles (need `patchelf`), the Windows `deas.exe` when `cargo xwin` is installed (NSIS/portable bundles come from `build-windows.cmd --release` on Windows), `SHA256SUMS` and `BUILD-MANIFEST.json`. The plain build always writes the development binary to `artifacts/deas-linux-amd64`. Details: [development and builds](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#local-linux-executable).

**Windows — Command Prompt:**

```bat
git clone https://github.com/darksidewalker/DEAS.git
cd DEAS
build-windows.cmd
artifacts\deas-windows-x86_64.exe
```

In the app, open **Backend**, review the installation, choose a **new writable environment folder**, and authorize **Start install**. DEAS manages Python, PyTorch and ComfyUI; Git and a compatible graphics driver remain prerequisites. Model weights are installed separately through Library or configured model folders. Adopting an existing ComfyUI folder is a separate, explicit option that rebuilds its venv ([Backend](docs/BACKEND.md#adopting-a-foreign-installation)). Follow [first setup and troubleshooting](docs/GETTING-STARTED.md#first-setup-inside-deas).
